<p id="N1069E" lang="">In this module, we are going to cover the various types of networks, including local area networks, wide area networks, personal area networks, and metropolitan area networks. Next, we will cover the various network relationships, such as client/server and peer-to-peer, and focus on the types of resources our networks use.

<p lang="">在本模塊中，我們將涵蓋各種類型的網絡，包括局域網，廣域網，個人局域網和城域網。 接下來，我們將介紹各種網絡關係，例如客戶端/服務器和對等網絡，並集中討論網絡使用的資源類型。 最後，我們將討論網絡的拓撲，例如總線，環形，星形，全網格和混合網絡拓撲。</p>
<p lang=""><strong>Network Defined By Geography 地理定義的網絡</strong></p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="N106A3">
<div class="sectionContain">
<p id="N106AA" lang="">Networks are defined by the geography they cover. We start with the area around a single person, with this area being termed the personal area network (PAN). Next, we expand outward to the local area network (LAN), which can contain an entire office floor or building. Moving outward again, we have the metropolitan area network, which covers the area across the city by connecting multiple LANs together. Finally, we have the wide area network (WAN). This is the largest network we define by geography and it can go across the country or even across the world. A great example of a WAN is the Internet, since it connects many networks together and stretches across the globe.</p>
<p lang="">網絡由其所覆蓋的地理位置定義。 我們從一個人周圍的區域開始，將該區域稱為個人區域網絡（PAN）。 接下來，我們向外擴展到局域網（LAN），該局域網可以包含整個辦公樓層或建築物。 再次向外移動，我們有了城域網，該城域網通過將多個LAN連接在一起而覆蓋了整個城市。 最後，我們有廣域網（WAN）。 這是我們按地理位置定義的最大網絡，它可以遍及全國，甚至遍及全球。 WAN就是一個很好的例子，因為Internet將許多網絡連接在一起並遍及全球。</p>
<p lang="" style="text-align: center;"><img src="https://oli.cmu.edu/repository/webcontent/d826575d0a0001dc3e9f244fa018c560/PCH09/webcontent/PCH09/image1.png"/></p>
<p lang=""><strong>Personal Area Network 個人區域網</strong></p>
<p id="N106E1" lang="">A PAN has a very small range limited to just a few meters. If you stretch your hands out at your sides and spin around in a circle, this is the physical range of most PANs. Bluetooth is one of the main things we use to create a PAN, although USB and infrared can also be used for these networks. Bluetooth has a range between one meter and 100 meters depending on which class of Bluetooth you are using, but most common Bluetooth devices are class two devices limited to 10 meters. Some good examples of PANs are the connection between a USB hard drive and a laptop, or a Bluetooth cellphone connecting to your car stereo system wirelessly.</p>
<p lang="">PAN的範圍很小，只有幾米。 如果您將雙手伸向兩側並轉一圈，則這是大多數PAN的物理範圍。 藍牙是我們用於創建PAN的主要內容之一，儘管USB和紅外也可以用於這些網絡。 藍牙的範圍在1米至100米之間，具體取決於您使用的藍牙類別，但是大多數常見的藍牙設備是限於10米的第二類設備。 PAN的一些很好的例子是USB硬盤驅動器和筆記本電腦之間的連接，或者是無線連接到汽車立體聲系統的藍牙手機。</p>
<p lang=""><strong>Local Area Network 局域網</strong></p>
<p id="N1070D" lang="">The next type of network defined by geography is the LAN, which stands for local area network. The local area network is comprised of several devices that allow computers to connect to each other within a small geographic area. A LAN is, at its most basic, a connection of several workstations together using a hub, switch, or wireless access point. LANs have a limited distance associated with them, with each network segment usually limited to 100 meters or less. Generally, a LAN is used to network the floor of an office, or possibly the entire office building in smaller networks. LANs are generally connected in either a wired or wireless manner. If wired, they are connected using unshielded twisted pair cable using the Ethernet (IEEE 802.3) standard; if wireless, they are connected using Wi-Fi radio signal (IEEE 802.11) standards.</p>
<p lang="">地理定義的下一種網絡類型是LAN，它代表局域網。 局域網由幾個設備組成，這些設備使計算機可以在一個較小的地理區域內相互連接。 局域網最基本的是使用集線器，交換機或無線訪問點將多個工作站連接在一起。 局域網的距離有限，每個網段通常限制在100米或更短。 通常，LAN用於將辦公室地板或較小網絡中的整個辦公樓聯網。 LAN通常以有線或無線方式連接。 如果已連接，則使用符合以太網（IEEE 802.3）標準的非屏蔽雙絞線電纜進行連接； 如果為無線，則它們使用Wi-Fi無線電信號（IEEE 802.11）標准進行連接。</p>
<p lang="" style="text-align: center;"><img src="https://oli.cmu.edu/repository/webcontent/d826575d0a0001dc3e9f244fa018c560/PCH09/webcontent/PCH09/image3.jpeg"/></p>
<p lang=""><strong>Metropolitan Area Networks 城域網</strong></p>
<p id="N1076F" lang="">Another way we can geographically define our networks is as a MAN. A metropolitan area network connects scattered locations across the city or county. This covers a larger geographical area than a local area network, but also a much smaller area than a wide-area network.</p>
<p lang="">我們可以在地理上定義網絡的另一種方法是將其作為MAN。 城域網連接整個城市或縣的分散位置。 這比局域網覆蓋更大的地理區域，但是比廣域網覆蓋的區域小得多。</p>
<p lang="" style="text-align: center;"><img src="https://oli.cmu.edu/repository/webcontent/d826575d0a0001dc3e9f244fa018c560/PCH09/webcontent/PCH09/image13.jpeg"/></p>
<p lang=""><strong>Wide Area Networks 廣域網</strong></p>
<p id="N10787" lang="">The WAN is used to connect network components that are geographically separated over vast distances together. An example of a WAN would be to connect an office in Los Angeles to another corporate office in New York. This can be done using virtual private networks (VPNs) over the Internet or using dedicated leased lines that would physically connect the city pairs together. Regardless of the method of connection, once the two local area networks from Los Angeles and New York are connected, they become part of the larger wide area network topology.</p>
<p lang="">WAN用於將地理位置遙遠的網絡組件連接在一起。 WAN的一個示例是將洛杉磯的辦公室連接到紐約的另一公司辦公室。 這可以通過Internet上的虛擬專用網絡（VPN）或使用將城市對實際連接在一起的專用租用線路來完成。 無論採用哪種連接方法，一旦將來自洛杉磯和紐約的兩個局域網連接起來，它們便成為更大的廣域網拓撲結構的一部分。</p>
<p lang="" style="text-align: center;"><img src="https://oli.cmu.edu/repository/webcontent/d826575d0a0001dc3e9f244fa018c560/PCH09/webcontent/PCH09/image14.jpeg"/></p>
<p lang=""></p>
<div class="title" style="text-align: center;"><strong>Network Defined by Relationships</strong></div>
<div class="title" style="text-align: center;"><strong>關係定義的網絡</strong></div>
<p lang=""><span>In addition to defining networks by geography or how much area they cover, you can also define them by the way they allocate their resources. The first method is what we call a client/server model. In a client/server model, a dedicated server or servers provide(s) access to files, scanners, printers, and other resources to client workstations. This simplifies the administration and backup burden, making the network centrally administered, and can provide better security because resources can be allocated according to job function, network privilege, or department, since all of the resources are located on a few key servers. The second way of sharing resources on the network is called the peer-to-peer model. In the peer-to-peer model, all workstations are considered equals: each computer or workstation shares its resources directly with the other workstations. There is no central administration. For example, if I shared my printer with my coworkers, then each time my coworker printed a document, it would be sent to the printer through my workstation. The drawback to this is that if my computer is turned off, my coworkers lose access to my resources, such as my printer. The administration and backup under the peer-to-peer model is much more difficult, since resources are located on numerous workstations across the network, making administrative tasks burdensome. Furthermore, there is no real way of securing network resources when allowing access between nodes or workstations. The benefit of peer-to-peer resource sharing is the low cost of entry, since no dedicated servers or specialized operating systems are required to share the resources.</span></p>
<p lang=""><span>除了按地理位置或網絡覆蓋範圍定義網絡外，您還可以通過它們分配資源的方式來定義網絡。第一種方法就是我們所說的客戶/服務器模型。在客戶端/服務器模型中，一個或多個專用服務器向客戶端工作站提供對文件，掃描儀，打印機和其他資源的訪問。由於所有資源都位於幾個關鍵服務器上，因此可以根據作業功能，網絡特權或部門分配資源，這簡化了管理和備份負擔，使網絡可以集中管理，並且可以提供更好的安全性。在網絡上共享資源的第二種方法稱為對等模型。在對等模型中，所有工作站都被認為是相等的：每台計算機或工作站直接與其他工作站共享其資源。沒有中央管理。例如，如果我與同事共享打印機，那麼每次同事打印文檔時，該文檔都會通過工作站發送到打印機。這樣做的缺點是，如果關閉計算機，我的同事將無法訪問我的資源，例如打印機。對等模型下的管理和備份要困難得多，因為資源位於網絡上的眾多工作站上，使管理任務變得很繁重。此外，當允許節點或工作站之間進行訪問時，沒有真正的方法來保護網絡資源。對等資源共享的好處是入門成本低，因為不需要專用服務器或專用操作系統來共享資源。</span></p>

<div class="title" style="text-align: center;"><strong>Network Defined by Topology</strong></div>
<div class="title" style="text-align: center;"><strong>拓撲定義的網絡</strong></div>
<p id="N10698" lang="">Besides geography and relationships, we can also define our networks by their topology. When we define our networks by their topology, we consider both the physical and logical topology, and both of these topologies do not have to match for a single network. The physical topology determines how the devices are physically connected, while the logical topology determines how the traffic flows across the network in a logical manner. There are many types of topologies, including bus, ring, star, full mesh, and hybrid. Currently, the most widely used model is a physical star and a logical bus topology using Ethernet.</p>
<p lang="">除了地理和關係之外，我們還可以通過其拓撲定義網絡。 當我們根據網絡的拓撲定義網絡時，我們會同時考慮物理和邏輯拓撲，並且這兩種拓撲都不必針對單個網絡進行匹配。 物理拓撲決定了設備的物理連接方式，而邏輯拓撲決定了流量如何以邏輯方式流經網絡。 拓撲類型很多，包括總線，環形，星形，全網格和混合拓撲。 當前，使用最廣泛的模型是使用以太網的物理星形和邏輯總線拓撲。</p>
<p lang=""><strong>Bus Topology 總線拓撲</strong></p>
<div class="section" id="N1069B">
<div class="sectionContain">
<p id="N106A2" lang="">Bus topology typically uses a single cable running through the area that needs network connectivity, with each device that wishes to connect to the network tapping into that cable. The devices tap into the cable using either a T connector (see diagram below) or a vampire tap. A vampire tap is actually a type of connection where a metal tooth bites into the cable, making a physical connection with the copper wire running inside the cable. While bus topology is an older technology and not commonly used anymore, physically, it can still be found as a logical implementation in some instances.</p>
<p lang="">總線拓撲通常使用一根電纜穿過需要網絡連接的區域，每個希望連接到網絡的設備都通過該電纜連接。 設備使用T型連接器（請參見下圖）或吸血鬼抽頭插入電纜。 吸血鬼抽頭實際上是一種連接，金屬齒咬入電纜，與電纜內部的銅線進行物理連接。 儘管總線拓撲是一項較舊的技術，在物理上已不再使用，但在某些情況下仍可以將其作為邏輯實現。</p>
<p lang="" style="text-align: center;"><img src="https://oli.cmu.edu/repository/webcontent/d826575d0a0001dc3e9f244fa018c560/PCH09/webcontent/PCH09/image15.png"/></p>
<p lang=""><strong>Ring Topology 環形拓撲</strong></p>
<p lang="">Ring topology typically uses a cable running in a circular loop, with each device connected to the ring. Data travels in a single direction around the ring. The most common use of ring topology is with backbone fiber networks. Fiber distributed data interface (FDDI) is a set of standards for transmitting data on fiber-optic lines in a LAN. FDDI commonly uses two counter-rotating rings to provide more redundancy. Each device waits its turn to communicate on the ring by passing a token around the ring. Therefore, ring topology networks are also called token ring networks. As there are two counter-rotating rings, FDDI tends to provide a little more redundancy than a standard bus topology. However, both bus and ring topologies were quickly replaced in most LANs by the star topology.</p>
<p lang="">環形拓撲通常使用在環形迴路中運行的電纜，每個設備都連接到環形。 數據在環上沿單個方向傳播。 環形拓撲最常見的用途是與骨幹光纖網絡一起使用。 光纖分佈式數據接口（FDDI）是用於在LAN中的光纖線上傳輸數據的一組標準。 FDDI通常使用兩個反向旋轉的環來提供更多的冗餘。 每個設備都通過在令牌環周圍傳遞令牌來等待其在令牌環上進行通信。 因此，環形拓撲網絡也稱為令牌環網絡。 由於有兩個反向旋轉的環，因此FDDI傾向於提供比標準總線拓撲更多的冗餘。 但是，在大多數LAN中，總線和環形拓撲都很快被星形拓撲取代。</p>
<p lang="" style="text-align: center;"><img src="https://oli.cmu.edu/repository/webcontent/d826575d0a0001dc3e9f244fa018c560/PCH09/webcontent/PCH09/image16.png"/></p>
<p lang=""><strong>Star Topology 星型拓撲</strong></p>
<p id="N106D6" lang="">Star topology is by far the most common topology in use today. We find star topologies in use in nearly all local area networks. All the devices of the star topology connect to a single point. That single point of connection can be a hub or switch. In most modern networks, the single connection point will be a switch. Star topologies are the dominant physical topology today, although they are not always used as the logical topology. Ethernet cabling, also known as unshielded twisted-pair, is very commonly employed in local area networks using a star configuration. However, fiber-optic connections can also be used for high-speed or high-security networks. The downside with the star topology is that it creates a single point of failure. If a central device such as a switch fails, the entire network fails as well. Star topologies have the benefit of reduced expense and make expansion very easy, unlike bus and ring network varieties.</p>
<p lang="">星形拓撲是迄今為止使用的最常見的拓撲。 我們發現幾乎所有局域網都使用星型拓撲。 星型拓撲的所有設備都連接到一個點。 單個連接點可以是集線器或交換機。 在大多數現代網絡中，單個連接點將是一個交換機。 星形拓撲是當今主要的物理拓撲，儘管它們並不總是用作邏輯拓撲。 以太網電纜，也稱為非屏蔽雙絞線，在採用星形配置的局域網中非常普遍。 但是，光纖連接也可以用於高速或高安全性網絡。 星形拓撲的缺點是會造成單點故障。 如果諸如交換機之類的中央設備發生故障，則整個網絡也會發生故障。 與總線和環形網絡品種不同，星形拓撲結構具有減少費用並易於擴展的優勢。</p>
<p id="N106D6" lang="" style="text-align: center;"><img src="https://oli.cmu.edu/repository/webcontent/d826575d0a0001dc3e9f244fa018c560/PCH09/webcontent/PCH09/image17.png"/></p>
<p lang=""><strong>Full Mesh Topology 全網狀拓撲</strong></p>
<p id="N106F0" lang="">To deal with the issue of redundancy, the full mesh topology was created. This topology is by far the most redundant, and expensive, topology because every node or workstation in the network is directly connected to every other node. While this provides optimal routing, it is very expensive to maintain and operate. The number of connections required for any number of nodes can be calculated by using the formula, x = n(n-1)/2. For example, if you have six nodes, that would require 15 cables to connect them all to each other. If you had 50 nodes, that would require 1225 separate connections. You can certainly see why this topology is almost never used for local area networks, as the number of machines would drive the number of connections up too quickly.</p>
<p lang="">為了解決冗餘問題，創建了全網狀拓撲。 到目前為止，此拓撲是最冗餘，最昂貴的拓撲，因為網絡中的每個節點或工作站都直接連接到每個其他節點。 儘管這提供了最佳的路由，但維護和操作非常昂貴。 可以使用公式x = n（n-1）/ 2計算任意數量的節點所需的連接數。 例如，如果您有六個節點，則需要15條電纜才能將它們彼此連接。 如果您有50個節點，則需要1225個單獨的連接。 您當然可以看到為什麼幾乎不將該拓撲用於局域網的原因，因為計算機數量過多會導致連接數量增加過快。</p>
<p lang="" style="text-align: center;"><img src="https://oli.cmu.edu/repository/webcontent/d826575d0a0001dc3e9f244fa018c560/PCH09/webcontent/PCH09/image18.png"/></p>
<p lang=""><strong>Partial Mesh Topology 部分網格拓撲</strong></p>
<p id="N1070A" lang="">To solve the cost issues created by the full mesh topology, engineers created the partial mesh topology. Partial mesh topology is really a hybrid full mesh topology. It provides redundancy and optimal routing between some sites, while avoiding the expense of connecting every single site. In order to create this successfully, though, you must consider the network traffic patterns to design it efficiently.</p>
<p lang="">為了解決由全網格拓撲創建的成本問題，工程師創建了部分網格拓撲。 部分網狀拓撲實際上是混合全網狀拓撲。 它提供了某些站點之間的冗餘和最佳路由，同時避免了連接每個站點的開銷。 但是，為了成功創建它，必須考慮網絡流量模式以進行有效設計。</p>

<div class="title" style="text-align: center;"><strong>Network Devices</strong></div>
<div class="title" style="text-align: center;"><strong>網絡設備</strong></div>
<p><strong>Overview</strong></p>
<div class="section" id="N10687">
<div class="sectionContain">
<p id="N1068E" lang="">Network devices vary according to their purpose. In this module, we will discuss various devices, such as hubs, switches, routers, bridges, network adapters, and media. As we discuss the devices, you should pay attention to their uses, their benefits, and their limitations. We will also explore how to install a network adapter.</p>
<p lang=""><strong>Hub</strong></p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="N10693">
<div class="sectionContain">
<p id="N1069A" lang="">Hubs are among the most simplistic networking devices and are used to connect multiple network devices and workstations to each other, thereby forming a network. Hubs are also known as multiport repeaters. A hub works by accepting a signal in one port and rebroadcasting that same signal out to all of its other ports. Standard hubs do not have any “intelligence” (ability to change in response to varying situations or requirements), so we often refer to them as “dumb hubs.” Hubs can be classified as either active or passive. An active hub repeats the signal it receives on all of its ports and amplifies that signal to full strength. Passive hubs only repeat the signal without adding any amplification. Hubs are an older technology that can be used to easily increase the number of ports available, but this can lead to excessive network errors and collisions. There are newer variants of hubs called smart hubs. Smart hubs are essentially active hubs with enhanced feature sets, such as the use of simple network management protocol (SNMP).</p>
<p id="N1069D" lang="">Three basic types of Ethernet hubs are as follows:</p>
<ul lang="">
<li lang="">Passive hub – repeats signal with no amplification</li>
<li lang="">Active hub – repeats signal with amplification</li>
<li lang="">Smart hub – active hub with enhanced features (ex: SNMP)</li>
</ul>
<p id="N106AC" lang="">Hubs have no inherent security designed within them because they simply rebroadcast all the information received from one port to every other port. Essentially, hubs rely on the connected workstations to only “listen” to the information on their port if that information is specifically addressed to that workstation. When the information is not addressed to it, the workstation is supposed to simply ignore the data. But a network card can be placed into “promiscuous” mode, where it will listen to all traffic, regardless of which workstation that traffic is addressed to. This makes hubs very insecure.</p>
<p id="N106AF" lang="">Another drawback of hubs is that they have to share bandwidth, as all devices operate in one collision domain. Therefore, if you have a 100 Mbps hub, but connect four devices to that hub, your devices will effectively be operating at 25 Mbps each. This can lead to huge slowdowns in your network traffic when using a 16-, 24-, or 48-port hub.</p>
<p lang="" style="text-align: center;"><img src="https://oli.cmu.edu/repository/webcontent/d826575d0a0001dc3e9f244fa018c560/PCH10/webcontent/PCH10/image1.jpeg"/></p>
<p lang=""><strong>Bridges</strong></p>
<p lang="">Because hubs operate with all devices acting in a single collision domain, a network device that could break up that collision domain into smaller units is required to help the network operate more efficiently. For example, if a hub is connected to another hub, they both operate under a single<span> </span><a aria-describedby="N106CD" class="extra" id=""></a>collision domain<span> </span>. A bridge is used to connect two hubs together, but still keep the hubs’ collision domains separate. This interconnection of multiple network segments together allows networks to scale into large networks without significantly decreasing the performance of that network. Bridges are smarter than hubs; in fact, they actually analyze the source<span> </span><a aria-describedby="N106D6" class="extra" id=""></a>media access control (MAC) addresses<span> </span>in the frames entering the bridge and populate an internal MAC table based on those addresses. Future routing decisions are based upon those destination MAC addresses. This intelligent forwarding based on the destination MAC address in the frame allows for a decrease in network traffic by only forwarding information to the root hub associated with the network device. Network switches, which we will discuss, are the evolution of hubs and bridges.</p>
<div class="section" id="N106C2">
<div class="sectionContain">
<p lang=""><strong>Switches</strong></p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="switches">
<div class="sectionContain">
<p id="N106E8" lang="">Switches are used to connect multiple network segments together, whether they connect from switch to switch, or switch to workstation. Each port on a switch acts as its own collision domain. A switch is an evolution from a hub and bridge. Essentially, each port on a switch operates as if it were a hub with a bridge connecting the ports of the hub to the workstation, thereby reducing the chance of a collision on the network to zero.</p>
<p id="N106EB" lang="">Switches are intelligent devices that make forwarding decisions based upon the MAC addresses they learn and place in their MAC tables. A switch analyzes the source MAC addresses in frames as they enter the switch, and then populates the switch’s internal MAC table with the addresses to match them with the switch ports. This allows the switch to forward the frame only to the correct device on a single switch port, thereby increasing security and network speed.</p>
<p id="N106EE" lang="">If a switch receives a frame but does not have the destination MAC address in its forwarding table, it will flood the frame to all ports except the source to solicit the location of the destination MAC address. Switches break up collision domains but create<span> </span><a aria-describedby="N106F2" class="extra" id=""></a>broadcast domains<span> </span>.</p>
<p id="N106FA" lang="">Security is increased because only the device to which the information is addressed can receive a copy, regardless of whether the card is in “promiscuous” mode. This is similar in operation to an old-fashioned telephone operator switchboard. If the information isn’t addressed to your port, your port won’t receive the information. Also, because each port is in its own collision domain, the network speed is increased. Regardless of how many devices are on the network, each switch port has full-speed operations, so for a 100 Mbps switch, each device operates at 100 Mbps.</p>
<p lang="" style="text-align: center;"><img src="https://oli.cmu.edu/repository/webcontent/d826575d0a0001dc3e9f244fa018c560/PCH10/webcontent/PCH10/image2.png"/></p>
<p lang=""><strong>Routers</strong></p>
<p id="N10714" lang="">Routers move data packets (layer 3), as opposed to switches (layer 2), which move frames. Routers separate network segments based on IP addressing and will only forward packets out of the segment when configured to do so. This design breaks up broadcast domains created by switches. It is up to the network professional to configure the router to connect different networks together and perform intelligent routing decisions. A router is most closely associated with a computer in that it has a processor and a sophisticated OS. The router compares the IP address of the source and destination of the packet and forwards traffic to/from a network based on this logical address (IPv4 and IPv6 addresses, for example). Routers are typically feature-rich devices and support a wide range of interface types, including unshielded twisted pair, fiber optic, and coaxial cable connections. Like a switch, each port on a router is a separate collision domain. Using access control lists, routers have the ability to block access to networks based on ports or addresses. This blocking adds to the network’s security.</p>

<p lang="" style="text-align: center;"><strong>Network Adapter</strong></p>
<p id="N1072F" lang="">The network adapter is used to connect a workstation to the network through the use of media. The network adapter can be built in to the motherboard of the device in several ways:</p>
<ul lang="">
<li lang="">Using an integrated port cluster.</li>
<li lang="">Added to a workstation through the use of an internal expansion card (PCIe, PCI, or mini-PCIe).</li>
<li lang="">Through the use of an externally connected card, such as USB or PCMCIA.</li>
</ul>
<p id="N1073E" lang="">There are two main types of network adapters: wired and wireless. The wired cards support various cable types, such as unshielded twisted pair (UTP), fiber optic, and coaxial cabling. These various cable types are called media.</p>
<p lang=""><strong>Media</strong></p>
<p id="N1074B" lang="">Media is the term used to categorize the physical connection between two device ports, such as between a computer and a switch. Media is made up of copper cable, fiber-optic cable, or even radio frequency waves (as used in Wi-Fi networks). Media varies greatly in cost, from free for radio waves, to cheap for unshielded twisted pair (copper cable), to expensive for fiber-optic cabling. The type of media determines the bandwidth speed, capacity, and distance limitations for a particular network. We will discuss media in more depth in a future module.</p>

<div class="title"><strong>Install a Network Adapter</strong></div>
<p lang=""><span>There are times when you may need to install an add-on network interface card (NIC). Current desktop motherboards should have a built-in NIC on the rear input/output (I/O) panel. Installing an add-on card can keep a machine in service if the built-in NIC is defective or if you need to upgrade to match the current local area network (LAN) specifications (i.e., from a 10/100 BaseT to 10/100/1000 or 10GBaseT).</span></p>
<p id="N106AF" lang="">To install an NIC, follow these steps:</p>
<ol lang="">
<li lang="">Check documentation to verify which NIC will match your expansion slots (PCI or PCIe) and the LAN requirements. Ensure that the adapter will work with the motherboard.</li>
<li lang="">Power down the computer and disconnect the main power cord from the machine.</li>
<li lang="">Following safe repair practice (proper grounding/anti-static strap), open the side cover of the computer to inspect available expansion slots.</li>
<li lang="">Match the connector/pinouts of the new NIC card and verify it matches the proposed slot.</li>
<li lang="">Remove the corresponding computer PCI option slot cover from the back panel.</li>
<li lang="">Line up the connector of the NIC to the expansion slot and seat it firmly as you guide the bracket up to the back panel of the computer, ensuring proper alignment. Tighten the new NIC with the screw that is usually supplied.</li>
<li lang="">Close the side cover of the computer following safe repair procedures.</li>
<li lang="">Reconnect the main power cord.</li>
<li lang="">Power up the machine.</li>
</ol>
<p id="N106D0" lang="">After the NIC hardware is installed, the drivers should install automatically, depending on the operating system. For Windows (Vista/Win7/Win8.1/Win10), verify connectivity in the network and sharing center. For Linux, go to network settings, and search online for the appropriate driver depending on the<span> </span><a aria-describedby="N106D4" class="extra" id=""></a>Linux distribution<span> </span>, such as Red Hat Linux or Ubuntu).</p>

<div class="title"><strong>Overview</strong></div>
<div class="title"><strong></strong></div>
<div class="title" style="text-align: center;">In this module, we’re going to discuss the various types of network media. We will begin with fiber-optic cable and then discuss twisted pair cable and coaxial cable. For each of these cable types, we will discuss appearance, characteristics, and types of connectors, as well as speed and limitations.</div>
<div class="section" id="N1067F">

<p lang=""><strong>Fiber-Optic Cable</strong></p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="fiber_cable">
<div class="sectionContain">
<p id="N10692" lang="">Fiber-optic cables are constructed by using a glass core at the center of the cable that is surrounded by cladding. In order to send data from one end of the cable to the other, light from a light-emitting diode (LED) or laser is used to transmit the signal down the glass fiber at the center of the cable. Because the data is being transmitted using light, it is immune to the effects of electromagnetic interference (EMI) that impact traditional copper-based cables, such as twisted pair and coaxial cables. Fiber-optic cables possess the ability to send the data a very far distance (many miles) without the use of a repeater. They also can carry a significant amount of data due to their large bandwidth and the information traveling at light speed. Their bandwidth can be measured in gigabits or even terabits per second. There are two types of fiber cables: multimode and single-mode fiber.</p>
<p lang="" style="text-align: center;"><img alt="Photograph of two cables, one with a red end and the other with a black end. Both have a silver connection with a cylindrical core protruding from the connector." src="https://oli.cmu.edu/repository/webcontent/d826575d0a0001dc3e9f244fa018c560/PCH11/webcontent/PCH11/image1.png"/></p>
<div class="section" id="fiber_cable">
<div class="sectionContain">
<p id="N106A2" lang="">Multimode fiber cables (MMF) contain a larger core than the single-mode variety. The core size for a multimode fiber is 62.5 microns. A micron is a very small unit of measurement—it is actually even smaller than the width of a human hair. MMF’s larger core enables multiple modes of travel for the light from one end of the cable to the other. This allows a single fiber to carry multiple signals across it, with each signal being transmitted at a slightly different reflective angle. When the light reaches the destination, the signals are then converted back into 1s and 0s and passed to the computer by the network interface card. Multimode fiber is commonly used in shorter distance fiber connections, such as from a router to a switch, a switch to a switch, or a server to a switch.</p>
<p id="N106A5" lang="">Single-mode fiber cables (SMF) contain a much smaller core than the multimode variety. The core size for SMF is 10 microns. SMF’s smaller core only allows for a single mode of travel for the light from one end of the cable to the other. This straight-through connection allows for data to travel longer distances without a repeater than it can travel using MMF. When the light reaches the destination, the signals are then converted back into 1s and 0s and passed to the computer by the network interface card. Single mode fiber is commonly used in very long distance fiber connections, such as a backbone connection from one local area network to another.</p>

<p lang=""><strong>Fiber-Optic Cable Connectors</strong></p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="fiber_connectors">
<div class="sectionContain">
<p id="N106B2" lang="">Fiber cables only come in the two types discussed above: single-mode and multimode. However, the ends of each of these cables come in four varieties.</p>
<p id="N106B5" lang="">The subscriber connector (SC) is a fiber-optic cable connector that uses a push-pull mechanism to latch into the port, similar to common audio and video cables. If you want to enable bidirectional transmission for sending and receiving data, you need to have two fiber cables, so sometimes a dual SC connector is used.</p>
<p id="N106B8" lang="">The straight tip (ST) connector is a fiber-optic cable connector that uses a bayonet plug and socket. It was the first de facto standard connector for most commercial wiring using fiber cables and it is very commonly found in fiber networks.</p>
<p id="N106BB" lang="">The Lucent connector (LC) is a miniaturized version of the fiber-optic SC connector. It looks somewhat like the SC, but is half the size, with a 1.25 mm ferrule instead of 2.5 mm, making it very useful when connecting multiple devices in a small area, such as on a 24-port switch’s front panel.</p>
<p id="N106BE" lang="">The mechanical transfer-registered jack (MT-RJ) connector is a fiber-optic cable connector that is very popular for small-form-factor devices due to its small size. This connector houses two fibers and mates with locating pins on the plug. These connectors are commonly found connecting a switch to a patch panel, because both devices have a limited area on their front panels.</p>
<p lang=""></p>
<div class="title" style="text-align: center;"><strong>Twisted Pair Cable</strong></div>
<p lang=""><span>While fiber-optic cable is great for its speed, distance, and security, it hasn’t yet become commonplace in most networks. Instead, we are still using the same type of cabling we have been using for the past two to three decades — twisted pair. Twisted pair cable is the most popular physical LAN media in the world today. Each cable contains four pairs of individually insulated strands of copper wire. Each pair is twisted together to minimize the amount of electromagnetic interference (EMI). The more twists there are in the cable, the less EMI there will be. Twisted pair cable is broken up into two types: unshielded twisted pair (UTP) and shielded twisted pair (STP).</span></p>
<p lang="" style="text-align: center;"><span><img alt="Photograph of connector. The end is transparent plastic and cables and copper connections are visible." src="https://oli.cmu.edu/repository/webcontent/d826575d0a0001dc3e9f244fa018c560/PCH11/webcontent/PCH11/image6.png"/></span></p>
<p id="N1069C" lang="">Shielded twisted pair cable is built very similarly to unshielded twisted pair, except that the pairs of wires are also surrounded by a metallic shielding (like foil). This outer foil shielding minimizes the EMI to which the cable is exposed. This increases the security and reliability of the cable. Unfortunately, however, this also increases the cost of the cable, so it is typically used only in high-production environments where the extra security is worth the extra cost.</p>
<p id="N1069F" lang="">The more common type of cabling is unshielded twisted pair cable. Instead of using extra shielding, this cable relies on the twisting of its copper pairs to minimize the effects of EMI. Each twisted pair is twisted to insulate itself from the other pairs, and because there is no additional shielding, it is available at a lower cost than STP. Therefore, UTP is the most common media of choice for small office, home office, residential, and many commercial networks.</p>
<p lang="" style="text-align: center;"><img alt="Photograph of a blue cable with part of the sheathing removed. Inside, there are four twisted pair cables: green and white, orange and white, blue and white, and brown and white. The four twisted pairs are also twisted together." src="https://oli.cmu.edu/repository/webcontent/d826575d0a0001dc3e9f244fa018c560/PCH11/webcontent/PCH11/image7.png"/></p>
<p lang=""><strong>Categorizing Twisted Pair Cable</strong></p>
<div class="section" id="categorizing_twisted_pair">
<div class="sectionContain">
<p id="N106B9" lang="">Twisted pair cable is categorized based on a category (cat) number. For example, cat 3, or category 3, is the oldest type of cable that we use. It was introduced back in the 1980s and 1990s for use in the first star topologies. The maximum throughput or bandwidth of cat 3 cabling is only 10 Mbps (megabits per second). The cat 3, like all twisted pair cabling, cannot go farther than 100 meters without using a repeater, switch, or active hub to amplify the signal. This limited distance is attributable to the copper wiring in these cables. As the signal travels over the copper wire, the natural resistance to the wire decreases the signal’s strength, and it eventually becomes too weak for the distant end to receive. For this reason, there is a 100 meter limitation when building and designing a twisted pair network.</p>
<p id="N106BC" lang="">Cat 5 cables were an improvement on the older cat 3 cables and contain more twists, giving them more shielding from EMI and a maximum bandwidth of 100 Mbps. Cat 5e, or cat 5 enhanced, increased the speed of the maximum throughput to one Gbps, or 1000 Mbps, and became a gap filler until cat 6 cabling became commonplace.</p>
<p id="N106BF" lang="">Cat 6a overcomes the 37-55 meter limitation of cat 6 when used in 10GBaseT. Cat 7, the newest standard, is shielded and provides connections up to 10 Gbps with a maximum distance of 100 meters. “Cat 7 and cat 7a cabling will be used for backbone connections between servers within a data center” and “provide an alternative to using fiber-optic cabling within the data center” (from<a href="http://www.cablestogo.com/learning/library/data-center/cat7-overview" id="_i_4" lang="" target="_blank">http://www.cablestogo.com/learning/library/data-center/cat7-overview</a>).</p>
<p id="N106C8" lang="">All cable categories up to cat 5e and cat 6a have a maximum distance of 100 meters. When used in 10GBaseT, the maximum distance for cat 6 is 55 meters. Cat 7 is shielded and exceeds the 100 meter limit. As the category of the cable increases, so do the number of twists per inch and the frequency range, allowing for more data and improved protection against EMI. Best practice for copper cabling is<span> </span><em class="italic" lang="">not<span> </span></em>to run cable lengths to the maximum because attenuation will reduce data capacity.</p>

<p><strong>Twisted Pair Connectors</strong></p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="N1072E">
<div class="sectionContain">
<p id="N10735" lang="">Twisted pair cables come with three main types of connectors. The first is the RJ-45 connector, which is an eight-pin connector used in Ethernet networks. Even though most Ethernet networks use only four pins, the RJ-45 provides eight pins for future use and capabilities. The first four pins are used to transmit (two pins) and receive (two pins).</p>
<p id="N10738" lang="">The RJ-11 connector is used in the standard telephone system. The RJ-11 is a six-pin connector, but commonly only two pins are used for a telephone (transmit and receive). If you have a two-line phone, then four pins are used: two pins to transmit and two pins to receive.</p>
<p id="N1073B" lang="">Finally, the DB-9 connector is used for RS-232 signals. This connector looks like a standard serial connector. It is used commonly for asynchronous serial communications, like connecting to an external modem. In modern networks, you will see this type of connector on a “rollover cable.” A rollover cable has a DB-9 on one side (which is connected to your laptop’s serial port), and an RJ-45 connector on the other side (which is used to connect to Cisco routers and switches to do administration tasks).</p>
<p id="N1073E" lang="">A straight-through cable is a type of twisted pair cable that is used in local area networks to connect a computer to a network hub, such as a router. This type of cable is also sometimes called a patch cable. Both ends of the cable have an identical pinout, hence the name “straight-through.” A crossover cable switches the pinouts of the two ends of the cable, making the transmit and receive pins alternate on the two ends. This allows two workstations to connect directly to each other without the need for a hub, switch, or router.</p>

<div class="title" style="text-align: center;"><strong>Coaxial Cable</strong></div>
<div class="title" style="text-align: center;"><strong></strong></div>
<div class="title" style="text-align: center;"><strong><span></span></strong></div>
<div class="title" style="text-align: center;"><span>Coaxial cable is a much older media technology. Coaxial cable, also known as coax for short, is composed of two conductors. The inner conductor, which is known as the insulated conductor (center wire), is the copper wire over which data is passed. The outer conductor is the braided metal shield and aids in protecting the inner wire from physical injury and the effects of EMI. Much like the shielding we saw in shielded twisted pair, the outer shield helps keep electromagnetic interference out of the data’s path. Between the inner conductor and the outer shield, we find an insulated core that prevents any data transfer between the inner core and outer shield. The outside of the cable is made of a flexible plastic jacket, much like the twisted pair cabling. Coaxial cabling was included in the first Ethernet standard as 10Base5 (thicknet) and continued to be used throughout updates as 10Base2 (thinnet) as well as being most commonly used in bus and ring networks. UTP cabling however, is easier to work with in a star topology and is significantly less expensive.</span></div>
<div class="title" style="text-align: center;"><span><img alt="Image of a black cable with connector. The ring securing the cable to the connector is removed to expose the braided metal shield.

<div class="title"><strong>Coaxial Cable Types</strong></div>
<div class="title">
<div class="section" id="N106A2">
<div class="sectionContain">
<p id="N106A9" lang="">There are three dominant coaxial cable types. The RG-6 is commonly used by cable TV companies to connect individual homes to the TV network. These cables are thick and usually used for outside connections to withstand the effects of the weather. The RG-58 is a type of coaxial cable that was heavily used in early 10Base2 (thinnet) networks, such as bus and ring topologies. Finally, the RG-59 is the traditional coaxial cable used to carry composite video between two nearby devices, such as your TV and the cable box. If you are a cable Internet user, this is also used to carry the WAN connection from your wall jack to your cable modem.</p>
<p lang=""><strong>Coaxial Cable Connectors</strong></p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="N106AE">
<div class="sectionContain">
<p id="N106B5" lang="">While there were three types of cables, there are only two types of common connectors used with coaxial cable. The first is called BNC, from the name Bayonet Neill-Concelman. Sometimes people also call this the British Naval connector, because the BNC was heavily used by the British in their shipboard radio systems. This connector was commonly used in early Ethernet networks and it has a “push and twist” type of connector to secure the cable to the network device.</p>
<p id="N106B8" lang="">The F-type connector is the modern type of coaxial cable connector. It is typically used for cable TV and cable modem connections. It is connected by screwing the connector onto a threaded jack to secure the connection.</p>
<p lang="" style="text-align: center;"><img alt="Photograph of a wall plate with five coaxial jacks. A coaxial cable with a blue band at the end is connected to one of the jacks." src="https://oli.cmu.edu/repository/webcontent/d826575d0a0001dc3e9f244fa018c560/PCH11/webcontent/PCH11/image10.png"/></p>
<p lang="" style="text-align: center;"></p>
<div class="title" style="text-align: center;"><strong>Copper vs. Fiber</strong></div>
<div class="title"><span>When we compare the advantages and disadvantages of fiber-optic cables and copper (twisted pair) cables, we have to consider that fiber-optic has a higher bandwidth (measured in Gbps or Tbps), it can carry its signal many miles without the need of a repeater, it is immune to the effects of EMI, and it has much better security than traditional twisted pair cables. However, twisted pair cabling does hold some advantages of its own. For one, it is much less expensive than fiber-optic cabling. Also, copper wiring is much easier to install, taking only a few hours to learn. Finally, twisted pair cabling can be created and terminated using inexpensive tools. For example, a complete copper wiring toolset can be bought online for less than $50, while a complete fiber-optic kit may cost $1000 or more. For these reasons, copper has remained the dominant media in most local area networks.</span></div>
<div class="title"><span></span></div>
<div class="title">
<div class="title" style="text-align: center;"><strong>Converters</strong></div>
<div class="title" style="text-align: center;">
<p id="N10678" lang="">Because of the wide variety of cable and connector types, there is sometimes a need to convert from one type of media to another. For example, if you have to make a connection between two LANs in buildings that are located one mile apart, but your network uses Cat 5e, UTP cabling, how can you make that connection? When you look at your routers, you find they only accept RJ-45 connections, but you know that you cannot run a Cat 5e cable more than 100 meters. How can you solve this problem? With a media converter.</p>
<p id="N1067B" lang="">Using a media converter, you can convert your RJ-45 connection into an ST, SC, or LC fiber connection, as shown in the image below. Then, you run the one-mile fiber cable to the other building, and use a media converter to convert from the ST, SC, or LC fiber connection back to the RJ-45 the other router requires. Because this is a simple, “dumb” device, it simply converts whatever is received on the first media type and repeats it back out the second media type. Common types of media converters are from Ethernet (copper) to fiber-optic (and back) or coaxial to fiber-optic (and back).</p>
<p lang=""><img alt="Photograph of four converters stacked on top of each other. The two converters in the middle are identical. They are each labeled Black Box and have a power cord receptacle, an Ethernet port and two other ports. The converter on the top has an Ethernet port and two other ports.
