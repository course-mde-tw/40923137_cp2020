Next, we will cover the various network relationships, such as client/server and peer-to-peer, and focus on the types of resources our networks use. Finally, we will talk about the topologies of our networks, such as the bus, the ring, the star, the full mesh, and hybrid network topologies. \n 在本模塊中，我們將涵蓋各種類型的網絡，包括局域網，廣域網，個人局域網和城域網。 接下來，我們將介紹各種網絡關係，例如客戶端/服務器和對等網絡，並集中討論網絡使用的資源類型。 最後，我們將討論網絡的拓撲，例如總線，環形，星形，全網格和混合網絡拓撲。 \n \n \n \n Network Defined By Geography\xa0地理定義的網絡 \n \n \n \n \n Networks are defined by the geography they cover. We start with the area around a single person, with this area being termed the personal area network (PAN). Next, we expand outward to the local area network (LAN), which can contain an entire office floor or building. Moving outward again, we have the metropolitan area network, which covers the area across the city by connecting multiple LANs together. Finally, we have the wide area network (WAN). This is the largest network we define by geography and it can go across the country or even across the world. A great example of a WAN is the Internet, since it connects many networks together and stretches across the globe. \n 網絡由其所覆蓋的地理位置定義。 我們從一個人周圍的區域開始，將該區域稱為個人區域網絡（PAN）。 接下來，我們向外擴展到局域網（LAN），該局域網可以包含整個辦公樓層或建築物。 再次向外移動，我們有了城域網，該城域網通過將多個LAN連接在一起而覆蓋了整個城市。 最後，我們有廣域網（WAN）。 這是我們按地理位置定義的最大網絡，它可以遍及全國，甚至遍及全球。 WAN就是一個很好的例子，因為Internet將許多網絡連接在一起並遍及全球。 \n \n \n \n Personal Area Network\xa0個人區域網 \n A PAN has a very small range limited to just a few meters. If you stretch your hands out at your sides and spin around in a circle, this is the physical range of most PANs. Bluetooth is one of the main things we use to create a PAN, although USB and infrared can also be used for these networks. Bluetooth has a range between one meter and 100 meters depending on which class of Bluetooth you are using, but most common Bluetooth devices are class two devices limited to 10 meters. Some good examples of PANs are the connection between a USB hard drive and a laptop, or a Bluetooth cellphone connecting to your car stereo system wirelessly. \n PAN的範圍很小，只有幾米。 如果您將雙手伸向兩側並轉一圈，則這是大多數PAN的物理範圍。 藍牙是我們用於創建PAN的主要內容之一，儘管USB和紅外也可以用於這些網絡。 藍牙的範圍在1米至100米之間，具體取決於您使用的藍牙類別，但是大多數常見的藍牙設備是限於10米的第二類設備。 PAN的一些很好的例子是USB硬盤驅動器和筆記本電腦之間的連接，或者是無線連接到汽車立體聲系統的藍牙手機。 \n \n \n \n Local Area Network\xa0局域網 \n The next type of network defined by geography is the LAN, which stands for local area network. The local area network is comprised of several devices that allow computers to connect to each other within a small geographic area. A LAN is, at its most basic, a connection of several workstations together using a hub, switch, or wireless access point. LANs have a limited distance associated with them, with each network segment usually limited to 100 meters or less. Generally, a LAN is used to network the floor of an office, or possibly the entire office building in smaller networks. LANs are generally connected in either a wired or wireless manner. If wired, they are connected using unshielded twisted pair cable using the Ethernet (IEEE 802.3) standard; if wireless, they are connected using Wi-Fi radio signal (IEEE 802.11) standards. \n 地理定義的下一種網絡類型是LAN，它代表局域網。 局域網由幾個設備組成，這些設備使計算機可以在一個較小的地理區域內相互連接。 局域網最基本的是使用集線器，交換機或無線訪問點將多個工作站連接在一起。 局域網的距離有限，每個網段通常限制在100米或更短。 通常，LAN用於將辦公室地板或較小網絡中的整個辦公樓聯網。 LAN通常以有線或無線方式連接。 如果已連接，則使用符合以太網（IEEE 802.3）標準的非屏蔽雙絞線電纜進行連接； 如果為無線，則它們使用Wi-Fi無線電信號（IEEE 802.11）標准進行連接。 \n \n \n \n \n Metropolitan Area Networks\xa0城域網 \n Another way we can geographically define our networks is as a MAN. A metropolitan area network connects scattered locations across the city or county. This covers a larger geographical area than a local area network, but also a much smaller area than a wide-area network. \n 我們可以在地理上定義網絡的另一種方法是將其作為MAN。 城域網連接整個城市或縣的分散位置。 這比局域網覆蓋更大的地理區域，但是比廣域網覆蓋的區域小得多。 \n \n \n \n \n Wide Area Networks\xa0廣域網 \n The WAN is used to connect network components that are geographically separated over vast distances together. An example of a WAN would be to connect an office in Los Angeles to another corporate office in New York. This can be done using virtual private networks (VPNs) over the Internet or using dedicated leased lines that would physically connect the city pairs together. Regardless of the method of connection, once the two local area networks from Los Angeles and New York are connected, they become part of the larger wide area network topology. \n WAN用於將地理位置遙遠的網絡組件連接在一起。 WAN的一個示例是將洛杉磯的辦公室連接到紐約的另一公司辦公室。 這可以通過Internet上的虛擬專用網絡（VPN）或使用將城市對實際連接在一起的專用租用線路來完成。 無論採用哪種連接方法，一旦將來自洛杉磯和紐約的兩個局域網連接起來，它們便成為更大的廣域網拓撲結構的一部分。 \n \n \n \n \n Network Defined by Relationships \n 關係定義的網絡 \n In addition to defining networks by geography or how much area they cover, you can also define them by the way they allocate their resources. The first method is what we call a client/server model. In a client/server model, a dedicated server or servers provide(s) access to files, scanners, printers, and other resources to client workstations. This simplifies the administration and backup burden, making the network centrally administered, and can provide better security because resources can be allocated according to job function, network privilege, or department, since all of the resources are located on a few key servers. The second way of sharing resources on the network is called the peer-to-peer model. In the peer-to-peer model, all workstations are considered equals: each computer or workstation shares its resources directly with the other workstations. There is no central administration. For example, if I shared my printer with my coworkers, then each time my coworker printed a document, it would be sent to the printer through my workstation. The drawback to this is that if my computer is turned off, my coworkers lose access to my resources, such as my printer. The administration and backup under the peer-to-peer model is much more difficult, since resources are located on numerous workstations across the network, making administrative tasks burdensome. Furthermore, there is no real way of securing network resources when allowing access between nodes or workstations. The benefit of peer-to-peer resource sharing is the low cost of entry, since no dedicated servers or specialized operating systems are required to share the resources. \n 除了按地理位置或網絡覆蓋範圍定義網絡外，您還可以通過它們分配資源的方式來定義網絡。第一種方法就是我們所說的客戶/服務器模型。在客戶端/服務器模型中，一個或多個專用服務器向客戶端工作站提供對文件，掃描儀，打印機和其他資源的訪問。由於所有資源都位於幾個關鍵服務器上，因此可以根據作業功能，網絡特權或部門分配資源，這簡化了管理和備份負擔，使網絡可以集中管理，並且可以提供更好的安全性。在網絡上共享資源的第二種方法稱為對等模型。在對等模型中，所有工作站都被認為是相等的：每台計算機或工作站直接與其他工作站共享其資源。沒有中央管理。例如，如果我與同事共享打印機，那麼每次同事打印文檔時，該文檔都會通過工作站發送到打印機。這樣做的缺點是，如果關閉計算機，我的同事將無法訪問我的資源，例如打印機。對等模型下的管理和備份要困難得多，因為資源位於網絡上的眾多工作站上，使管理任務變得很繁重。此外，當允許節點或工作站之間進行訪問時，沒有真正的方法來保護網絡資源。對等資源共享的好處是入門成本低，因為不需要專用服務器或專用操作系統來共享資源。 \n \n \n \n \n \n Network Defined by Topology \n 拓撲定義的網絡 \n Besides geography and relationships, we can also define our networks by their topology. When we define our networks by their topology, we consider both the physical and logical topology, and both of these topologies do not have to match for a single network. The physical topology determines how the devices are physically connected, while the logical topology determines how the traffic flows across the network in a logical manner. There are many types of topologies, including bus, ring, star, full mesh, and hybrid. Currently, the most widely used model is a physical star and a logical bus topology using Ethernet. \n 除了地理和關係之外，我們還可以通過其拓撲定義網絡。 當我們根據網絡的拓撲定義網絡時，我們會同時考慮物理和邏輯拓撲，並且這兩種拓撲都不必針對單個網絡進行匹配。 物理拓撲決定了設備的物理連接方式，而邏輯拓撲決定了流量如何以邏輯方式流經網絡。 拓撲類型很多，包括總線，環形，星形，全網格和混合拓撲。 當前，使用最廣泛的模型是使用以太網的物理星形和邏輯總線拓撲。 \n \n \n \n Bus Topology\xa0總線拓撲 \n \n \n Bus topology typically uses a single cable running through the area that needs network connectivity, with each device that wishes to connect to the network tapping into that cable. The devices tap into the cable using either a T connector (see diagram below) or a vampire tap. A vampire tap is actually a type of connection where a metal tooth bites into the cable, making a physical connection with the copper wire running inside the cable. While bus topology is an older technology and not commonly used anymore, physically, it can still be found as a logical implementation in some instances. \n 總線拓撲通常使用一根電纜穿過需要網絡連接的區域，每個希望連接到網絡的設備都通過該電纜連接。 設備使用T型連接器（請參見下圖）或吸血鬼抽頭插入電纜。 吸血鬼抽頭實際上是一種連接，金屬齒咬入電纜，與電纜內部的銅線進行物理連接。 儘管總線拓撲是一項較舊的技術，在物理上已不再使用，但在某些情況下仍可以將其作為邏輯實現。 \n \n \n \n \n Ring Topology\xa0環形拓撲 \n Ring topology typically uses a cable running in a circular loop, with each device connected to the ring. Data travels in a single direction around the ring. The most common use of ring topology is with backbone fiber networks. Fiber distributed data interface (FDDI) is a set of standards for transmitting data on fiber-optic lines in a LAN. FDDI commonly uses two counter-rotating rings to provide more redundancy. Each device waits its turn to communicate on the ring by passing a token around the ring. Therefore, ring topology networks are also called token ring networks. As there are two counter-rotating rings, FDDI tends to provide a little more redundancy than a standard bus topology. However, both bus and ring topologies were quickly replaced in most LANs by the star topology. \n 環形拓撲通常使用在環形迴路中運行的電纜，每個設備都連接到環形。 數據在環上沿單個方向傳播。 環形拓撲最常見的用途是與骨幹光纖網絡一起使用。 光纖分佈式數據接口（FDDI）是用於在LAN中的光纖線上傳輸數據的一組標準。 FDDI通常使用兩個反向旋轉的環來提供更多的冗餘。 每個設備都通過在令牌環周圍傳遞令牌來等待其在令牌環上進行通信。 因此，環形拓撲網絡也稱為令牌環網絡。 由於有兩個反向旋轉的環，因此FDDI傾向於提供比標準總線拓撲更多的冗餘。 但是，在大多數LAN中，總線和環形拓撲都很快被星形拓撲取代。 \n \n \n \n \n Star Topology\xa0星型拓撲 \n Star topology is by far the most common topology in use today. We find star topologies in use in nearly all local area networks. All the devices of the star topology connect to a single point. That single point of connection can be a hub or switch. In most modern networks, the single connection point will be a switch. Star topologies are the dominant physical topology today, although they are not always used as the logical topology. Ethernet cabling, also known as unshielded twisted-pair, is very commonly employed in local area networks using a star configuration. However, fiber-optic connections can also be used for high-speed or high-security networks. The downside with the star topology is that it creates a single point of failure. If a central device such as a switch fails, the entire network fails as well. Star topologies have the benefit of reduced expense and make expansion very easy, unlike bus and ring network varieties. \n 星形拓撲是迄今為止使用的最常見的拓撲。 我們發現幾乎所有局域網都使用星型拓撲。 星型拓撲的所有設備都連接到一個點。 單個連接點可以是集線器或交換機。 在大多數現代網絡中，單個連接點將是一個交換機。 星形拓撲是當今主要的物理拓撲，儘管它們並不總是用作邏輯拓撲。 以太網電纜，也稱為非屏蔽雙絞線，在採用星形配置的局域網中非常普遍。 但是，光纖連接也可以用於高速或高安全性網絡。 星形拓撲的缺點是會造成單點故障。 如果諸如交換機之類的中央設備發生故障，則整個網絡也會發生故障。 與總線和環形網絡品種不同，星形拓撲結構具有減少費用並易於擴展的優勢。 \n \n \n \n \n \n Full Mesh Topology\xa0全網狀拓撲 \n To deal with the issue of redundancy, the full mesh topology was created. This topology is by far the most redundant, and expensive, topology because every node or workstation in the network is directly connected to every other node. While this provides optimal routing, it is very expensive to maintain and operate. The number of connections required for any number of nodes can be calculated by using the formula, x = n(n-1)/2. For example, if you have six nodes, that would require 15 cables to connect them all to each other. If you had 50 nodes, that would require 1225 separate connections. You can certainly see why this topology is almost never used for local area networks, as the number of machines would drive the number of connections up too quickly. \n 為了解決冗餘問題，創建了全網狀拓撲。 到目前為止，此拓撲是最冗餘，最昂貴的拓撲，因為網絡中的每個節點或工作站都直接連接到每個其他節點。 儘管這提供了最佳的路由，但維護和操作非常昂貴。 可以使用公式x = n（n-1）/ 2計算任意數量的節點所需的連接數。 例如，如果您有六個節點，則需要15條電纜才能將它們彼此連接。 如果您有50個節點，則需要1225個單獨的連接。 您當然可以看到為什麼幾乎不將該拓撲用於局域網的原因，因為計算機數量過多會導致連接數量增加過快。 \n \n \n \n \n \n Partial Mesh Topology\xa0部分網格拓撲 \n To solve the cost issues created by the full mesh topology, engineers created the partial mesh topology. Partial mesh topology is really a hybrid full mesh topology. It provides redundancy and optimal routing between some sites, while avoiding the expense of connecting every single site. In order to create this successfully, though, you must consider the network traffic patterns to design it efficiently. \n 為了解決由全網格拓撲創建的成本問題，工程師創建了部分網格拓撲。 部分網狀拓撲實際上是混合全網狀拓撲。 它提供了某些站點之間的冗餘和最佳路由，同時避免了連接每個站點的開銷。 但是，為了成功創建它，必須考慮網絡流量模式以進行有效設計。 \n \n \n \n \n', 'tags': '', 'url': 'PCH\xa09.html'}, {'title': 'PCH\xa010', 'text': 'PCH 10: Networking Hardware \n PCH 10：網絡硬件 \n \n Network Devices \n 網絡設備 \n \n Overview\xa0總覽 \n \n \n Network devices vary according to their purpose. In this module, we will discuss various devices, such as hubs, switches, routers, bridges, network adapters, and media. As we discuss the devices, you should pay attention to their uses, their benefits, and their limitations. We will also explore how to install a network adapter. \n 網絡設備根據其用途而有所不同。 在本模塊中，我們將討論各種設備，例如集線器，交換機，路由器，網橋，網絡適配器和媒體。 在討論設備時，您應注意其使用，其優點和局限性。 我們還將探討如何安裝網絡適配器。 \n \n \n \n Hub\xa0樞紐 \n \n \n \n \n Hubs are among the most simplistic networking devices and are used to connect multiple network devices and workstations to each other, thereby forming a network. Hubs are also known as multiport repeaters. A hub works by accepting a signal in one port and rebroadcasting that same signal out to all of its other ports. Standard hubs do not have any “intelligence” (ability to change in response to varying situations or requirements), so we often refer to them as “dumb hubs.” Hubs can be classified as either active or passive. An active hub repeats the signal it receives on all of its ports and amplifies that signal to full strength. Passive hubs only repeat the signal without adding any amplification. Hubs are an older technology that can be used to easily increase the number of ports available, but this can lead to excessive network errors and collisions. There are newer variants of hubs called smart hubs. Smart hubs are essentially active hubs with enhanced feature sets, such as the use of simple network management protocol (SNMP). \n 集線器是最簡單的網絡設備之一，用於將多個網絡設備和工作站相互連接，從而形成一個網絡。集線器也稱為多端口中繼器。集線器通過在一個端口中接收信號並將該信號重新廣播到其所有其他端口來工作。標準集線器沒有任何“智能”（能夠根據不同情況或要求進行更改的能力），因此我們通常將它們稱為“啞集線器”。集線器可以分為主動或被動兩種。活動集線器會在其所有端口上重複接收到的信號，並將該信號放大到最大強度。無源集線器僅重複信號而不增加任何放大。集線器是一種較舊的技術，可用於輕鬆增加可用端口的數量，但這會導致過多的網絡錯誤和衝突。集線器有較新的變體，稱為智能集線器。智能集線器實質上是具有增強功能集（例如，使用簡單網絡管理協議（SNMP））的活動集線器。 \n Three basic types of Ethernet hubs are as follows: \n 以太網集線器的三種基本類型如下： \n \n Passive hub – repeats signal with no amplification\xa0 無源集線器–重複信號而不放大 \n Active hub – repeats signal with amplification\xa0有源集線器–重複放大信號 \n Smart hub – active hub with enhanced features (ex: SNMP)\xa0智能集線器–具有增強功能的活動集線器（例如：SNMP） \n \n Hubs have no inherent security designed within them because they simply rebroadcast all the information received from one port to every other port. Essentially, hubs rely on the connected workstations to only “listen” to the information on their port if that information is specifically addressed to that workstation. When the information is not addressed to it, the workstation is supposed to simply ignore the data. But a network card can be placed into “promiscuous” mode, where it will listen to all traffic, regardless of which workstation that traffic is addressed to. This makes hubs very insecure. \n 集線器內部沒有設計固有的安全性，因為它們只是將從一個端口接收的所有信息重新廣播到另一個端口。 本質上，集線器僅依賴於連接的工作站來“偵聽”其端口上的信息（如果該信息專門針對該工作站）。 當信息沒有發送給它時，工作站應該只是忽略數據。 但是，可以將網卡置於“混雜”模式，在該模式下，網卡將偵聽所有流量，而不管該流量指向哪個工作站。 這使集線器非常不安全。 \n Another drawback of hubs is that they have to share bandwidth, as all devices operate in one collision domain. Therefore, if you have a 100 Mbps hub, but connect four devices to that hub, your devices will effectively be operating at 25 Mbps each. This can lead to huge slowdowns in your network traffic when using a 16-, 24-, or 48-port hub. \n 集線器的另一個缺點是它們必須共享帶寬，因為所有設備都在一個衝突域中運行。 因此，如果您有一個100 Mbps的集線器，但將四個設備連接到該集線器，則每個設備將有效地以25 Mbps的速度運行。 使用16端口，24端口或48端口集線器時，這可能會導致網絡流量大幅下降。 \n \n \n \n \n \n Bridges\xa0橋樑 \n Because hubs operate with all devices acting in a single collision domain, a network device that could break up that collision domain into smaller units is required to help the network operate more efficiently. For example, if a hub is connected to another hub, they both operate under a single \xa0 collision domain \xa0 . A bridge is used to connect two hubs together, but still keep the hubs’ collision domains separate. This interconnection of multiple network segments together allows networks to scale into large networks without significantly decreasing the performance of that network. Bridges are smarter than hubs; in fact, they actually analyze the source \xa0 media access control (MAC) addresses \xa0 in the frames entering the bridge and populate an internal MAC table based on those addresses. Future routing decisions are based upon those destination MAC addresses. This intelligent forwarding based on the destination MAC address in the frame allows for a decrease in network traffic by only forwarding information to the root hub associated with the network device. Network switches, which we will discuss, are the evolution of hubs and bridges. \n 因為集線器與所有在單個衝突域中起作用的設備一起運行，所以需要一個可以將該衝突域分解為較小單元的網絡設備，以幫助網絡更高效地運行。例如，如果一個集線器連接到另一個集線器，則它們都在單個衝突域下運行。橋用於將兩個集線器連接在一起，但仍使集線器的衝突域保持分離。多個網段的這種互連在一起使網絡可以擴展到大型網絡，而不會顯著降低該網絡的性能。橋比集線器更智能；實際上，他們實際上是分析進入網橋的幀中的源媒體訪問控制（MAC）地址，並根據這些地址填充內部MAC表。未來的路由決策將基於那些目標MAC地址。通過僅將信息轉發到與網絡設備關聯的根集線器，這種基於幀中目標MAC地址的智能轉發可以減少網絡流量。我們將討論的網絡交換機是集線器和網橋的演進。 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Switches\xa0開關 \n \n \n \n \n Switches are used to connect multiple network segments together, whether they connect from switch to switch, or switch to workstation. Each port on a switch acts as its own collision domain. A switch is an evolution from a hub and bridge. Essentially, each port on a switch operates as if it were a hub with a bridge connecting the ports of the hub to the workstation, thereby reducing the chance of a collision on the network to zero. \n 交換機用於將多個網段連接在一起，無論它們是從交換機到交換機還是從工作站到工作站。 交換機上的每個端口都充當其自己的衝突域。 交換機是集線器和網橋的演進。 本質上，交換機上的每個端口都像是集線器一樣工作，帶有將集線器的端口連接到工作站的網橋，從而將網絡衝突的機會降低到零。 \n Switches are intelligent devices that make forwarding decisions based upon the MAC addresses they learn and place in their MAC tables. A switch analyzes the source MAC addresses in frames as they enter the switch, and then populates the switch’s internal MAC table with the addresses to match them with the switch ports. This allows the switch to forward the frame only to the correct device on a single switch port, thereby increasing security and network speed. \n 交換機是智能設備，它們根據其學習到的MAC地址並放置在其MAC表中來做出轉發決策。 交換機在輸入源MAC地址時會分析它們進入交換機的幀，然後用地址填充交換機的內部MAC表，以使其與交換機端口匹配。 這樣，交換機就可以將幀僅轉發到單個交換機端口上的正確設備，從而提高安全性和網絡速度。 \n If a switch receives a frame but does not have the destination MAC address in its forwarding table, it will flood the frame to all ports except the source to solicit the location of the destination MAC address. Switches break up collision domains but create \xa0 broadcast domains \xa0 . \n 如果交換機接收到幀，但在其轉發表中沒有目標MAC地址，則它將將該幀泛洪到除源之外的所有端口上，以請求目標MAC地址的位置。 交換器分解衝突域，但創建廣播域。 \n Security is increased because only the device to which the information is addressed can receive a copy, regardless of whether the card is in “promiscuous” mode. This is similar in operation to an old-fashioned telephone operator switchboard. If the information isn’t addressed to your port, your port won’t receive the information. Also, because each port is in its own collision domain, the network speed is increased. Regardless of how many devices are on the network, each switch port has full-speed operations, so for a 100 Mbps switch, each device operates at 100 Mbps. \n 安全性提高了，因為無論信息卡是否處於“混雜”模式，只有信息所針對的設備才能收到副本。 這在操作上類似於老式的電話接線員總機。 如果信息未發送到您的端口，則您的端口將不會收到該信息。 另外，由於每個端口都在其自己的衝突域中，因此網絡速度得以提高。 無論網絡上有多少設備，每個交換機端口都可以全速運行，因此對於100 Mbps交換機，每個設備都以100 Mbps的速度運行。 \n \n \n \n \n \n Routers\xa0路由器 \n Routers move data packets (layer 3), as opposed to switches (layer 2), which move frames. Routers separate network segments based on IP addressing and will only forward packets out of the segment when configured to do so. This design breaks up broadcast domains created by switches. It is up to the network professional to configure the router to connect different networks together and perform intelligent routing decisions. A router is most closely associated with a computer in that it has a processor and a sophisticated OS. The router compares the IP address of the source and destination of the packet and forwards traffic to/from a network based on this logical address (IPv4 and IPv6 addresses, for example). Routers are typically feature-rich devices and support a wide range of interface types, including unshielded twisted pair, fiber optic, and coaxial cable connections. Like a switch, each port on a router is a separate collision domain. Using access control lists, routers have the ability to block access to networks based on ports or addresses. This blocking adds to the network’s security. \n 路由器移動數據包（第3層），而交換機移動第2層（幀）。路由器基於IP尋址將網段分開，並且僅在配置時將數據包轉發出網段。這種設計可以分解由交換機創建的廣播域。由網絡專業人員決定將路由器配置為將不同的網絡連接在一起並執行智能路由決策。路由器與計算機的關係最為密切，因為它具有處理器和復雜的操作系統。路由器比較數據包源和目標的IP地址，並基於此邏輯地址（例如，IPv4和IPv6地址）將流量轉發到網絡或從網絡轉發流量。路由器通常是功能豐富的設備，並支持多種接口類型，包括非屏蔽雙絞線，光纖和同軸電纜連接。像交換機一樣，路由器上的每個端口都是一個單獨的衝突域。使用訪問控制列表，路由器可以根據端口或地址阻止對網絡的訪問。這種阻止會增加網絡的安全性。 \n \n \n Network Adapter \n 網絡適配器 \n \n The network adapter is used to connect a workstation to the network through the use of media. The network adapter can be built in to the motherboard of the device in several ways: \n 網絡適配器用於通過使用媒體將工作站連接到網絡。 可以通過幾種方式將網絡適配器內置到設備的主板中： \n \n Using an integrated port cluster.\xa0使用集成端口集群。 \n Added to a workstation through the use of an internal expansion card (PCIe, PCI, or mini-PCIe).\xa0通過使用內部擴展卡（PCIe，PCI或mini-PCIe）添加到工作站。 \n Through the use of an externally connected card, such as USB or PCMCIA.\xa0通過使用外部連接的卡，例如USB或PCMCIA。 \n \n There are two main types of network adapters: wired and wireless. The wired cards support various cable types, such as unshielded twisted pair (UTP), fiber optic, and coaxial cabling. These various cable types are called media. \n 網絡適配器有兩種主要類型：有線和無線。 有線卡支持各種電纜類型，例如非屏蔽雙絞線（UTP），光纖和同軸電纜。 這些各種電纜類型稱為媒體。 \n \xa0 \n \n \n \n Media\xa0媒體 \n Media is the term used to categorize the physical connection between two device ports, such as between a computer and a switch. Media is made up of copper cable, fiber-optic cable, or even radio frequency waves (as used in Wi-Fi networks). Media varies greatly in cost, from free for radio waves, to cheap for unshielded twisted pair (copper cable), to expensive for fiber-optic cabling. The type of media determines the bandwidth speed, capacity, and distance limitations for a particular network. We will discuss media in more depth in a future module. \n 媒體是用於對兩個設備端口之間（例如計算機和交換機之間）的物理連接進行分類的術語。 介質由銅纜，光纜或什至是射頻波（用於Wi-Fi網絡）組成。 介質的成本差異很大，從無線電波的免費成本到非屏蔽雙絞線（銅纜）的價格便宜，再到光纖電纜的價格昂貴。 媒體的類型確定特定網絡的帶寬速度，容量和距離限制。 我們將在以後的模塊中更深入地討論媒體。 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Install a Network Adapter\xa0安裝網絡適配器 \n There are times when you may need to install an add-on network interface card (NIC). Current desktop motherboards should have a built-in NIC on the rear input/output (I/O) panel. Installing an add-on card can keep a machine in service if the built-in NIC is defective or if you need to upgrade to match the current local area network (LAN) specifications (i.e., from a 10/100 BaseT to 10/100/1000 or 10GBaseT). \n 有時您可能需要安裝附加網絡接口卡（NIC）。 當前的台式機主板的後方輸入/輸出（I / O）面板上應具有內置的NIC。 如果內置NIC出現故障，或者需要升級以匹配當前的局域網（LAN）規格（即從10/100 BaseT到10/100），則安裝附加卡可以使機器保持運行狀態。 / 1000或10GBaseT）。 \n To install an NIC, follow these steps: \n 要安裝NIC，請按照下列步驟操作： \n \n Check documentation to verify which NIC will match your expansion slots (PCI or PCIe) and the LAN requirements. Ensure that the adapter will work with the motherboard. \n Power down the computer and disconnect the main power cord from the machine. \n Following safe repair practice (proper grounding/anti-static strap), open the side cover of the computer to inspect available expansion slots. \n Match the connector/pinouts of the new NIC card and verify it matches the proposed slot. \n Remove the corresponding computer PCI option slot cover from the back panel. \n Line up the connector of the NIC to the expansion slot and seat it firmly as you guide the bracket up to the back panel of the computer, ensuring proper alignment. Tighten the new NIC with the screw that is usually supplied. \n Close the side cover of the computer following safe repair procedures. \n Reconnect the main power cord. \n Power up the machine. \n \n After the NIC hardware is installed, the drivers should install automatically, depending on the operating system. For Windows (Vista/Win7/Win8.1/Win10), verify connectivity in the network and sharing center. For Linux, go to network settings, and search online for the appropriate driver depending on the \xa0 Linux distribution \xa0 , such as Red Hat Linux or Ubuntu). \n 安裝NIC硬件後，驅動程序應根據操作系統自動安裝。 對於Windows（Vista / Win7 / Win8.1 / Win10），請驗證網絡和共享中心中的連接。 對於Linux，請轉到網絡設置，然後根據Linux發行版（例如Red Hat Linux或Ubuntu）在線搜索適當的驅動程序。 \n \n \n \n \n \n', 'tags': '', 'url': 'PCH\xa010.html'}, {'title': 'PCH\xa011', 'text': 'PCH 11: Networking Media \n PCH 11：網絡媒體 \n \n \n Fiber-Optic Cable \n 光纖電纜 \n \n \n Overview\xa0總覽 \n \n In this module, we’re going to discuss the various types of network media. We will begin with fiber-optic cable and then discuss twisted pair cable and coaxial cable. For each of these cable types, we will discuss appearance, characteristics, and types of connectors, as well as speed and limitations. \n 在本模塊中，我們將討論各種類型的網絡媒體。 我們將從光纖電纜開始，然後討論雙絞線電纜和同軸電纜。 對於每種電纜類型，我們將討論連接器的外觀，特性和類型，以及速度和限制。 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Fi ber-Optic Cable\xa0光纖電纜 \n Fiber-optic cables are constructed by using a glass core at the center of the cable that is surrounded by cladding. In order to send data from one end of the cable to the other, light from a light-emitting diode (LED) or laser is used to transmit the signal down the glass fiber at the center of the cable. Because the data is being transmitted using light, it is immune to the effects of electromagnetic interference (EMI) that impact traditional copper-based cables, such as twisted pair and coaxial cables. Fiber-optic cables possess the ability to send the data a very far distance (many miles) without the use of a repeater. They also can carry a significant amount of data due to their large bandwidth and the information traveling at light speed. Their bandwidth can be measured in gigabits or even terabits per second. There are two types of fiber cables: multimode and single-mode fiber. \n 光纖電纜是通過在電纜的中心使用玻璃芯構成的，該芯層被包層圍繞。 為了將數據從電纜的一端發送到另一端，可使用來自發光二極管（LED）或激光的光沿電纜中心的玻璃纖維向下傳輸信號。 由於數據是通過光傳輸的，因此不受電磁干擾（EMI）的影響，電磁干擾會影響傳統的銅基電纜，如雙絞線和同軸電纜。 光纖具有無需使用中繼器就可以很遠的距離（許多英里）發送數據的能力。 由於它們的大帶寬和以光速傳播的信息，它們還可以攜帶大量數據。 它們的帶寬可以每秒千兆比特或什至兆兆比特來度量。 光纖電纜有兩種類型：多模和單模光纖。 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Multimode fiber cables (MMF) contain a larger core than the single-mode variety. The core size for a multimode fiber is 62.5 microns. A micron is a very small unit of measurement—it is actually even smaller than the width of a human hair. MMF’s larger core enables multiple modes of travel for the light from one end of the cable to the other. This allows a single fiber to carry multiple signals across it, with each signal being transmitted at a slightly different reflective angle. When the light reaches the destination, the signals are then converted back into 1s and 0s and passed to the computer by the network interface card. Multimode fiber is commonly used in shorter distance fiber connections, such as from a router to a switch, a switch to a switch, or a server to a switch. \n 多模光纜（MMF）的芯線比單模光纜大。 多模光纖的纖芯尺寸為62.5微米。 微米是非常小的度量單位，實際上甚至比人類頭髮的寬度還小。 MMF的較大芯線實現了從電纜一端到另一端的多種傳播模式。 這樣一來，單根光纖就可以在其上傳輸多個信號，而每個信號都以稍微不同的反射角傳輸。 當光線到達目的地時，信號然後被轉換回1和0，並通過網絡接口卡傳遞到計算機。 多模光纖通常用於較短距離的光纖連接中，例如從路由器到交換機，從交換機到交換機或從服務器到交換機。 \n Single-mode fiber cables (SMF) contain a much smaller core than the multimode variety. The core size for SMF is 10 microns. SMF’s smaller core only allows for a single mode of travel for the light from one end of the cable to the other. This straight-through connection allows for data to travel longer distances without a repeater than it can travel using MMF. When the light reaches the destination, the signals are then converted back into 1s and 0s and passed to the computer by the network interface card. Single mode fiber is commonly used in very long distance fiber connections, such as a backbone connection from one local area network to another. \n 單模光纜（SMF）的芯線比多模光纜小得多。 SMF的芯尺寸為10微米。 SMF的較小芯線僅允許光從電纜一端到另一端的單一傳播模式。 這種直通連接允許數據在沒有中繼器的情況下傳輸的距離比使用MMF傳輸的距離更長。 當光線到達目的地時，信號然後被轉換回1和0，並通過網絡接口卡傳遞到計算機。 單模光纖通常用於超長距離的光纖連接中，例如從一個局域網到另一個局域網的骨干連接。 \n \n \n \n \n Fiber-Optic Cable Connectors\xa0光纖電纜連接器 \n \n \n \n \n Fiber cables only come in the two types discussed above: single-mode and multimode. However, the ends of each of these cables come in four varieties. \n 光纖電纜僅屬於上述兩種類型：單模和多模。 但是，每條電纜的末端都有四種。 \n The subscriber connector (SC) is a fiber-optic cable connector that uses a push-pull mechanism to latch into the port, similar to common audio and video cables. If you want to enable bidirectional transmission for sending and receiving data, you need to have two fiber cables, so sometimes a dual SC connector is used. \n 用戶連接器（SC）是一種光纖電纜連接器，類似於普通的音頻和視頻電纜，它使用推挽機制鎖入端口。 如果要啟用雙向傳輸以發送和接收數據，則需要兩條光纖電纜，因此有時會使用雙SC連接器。 \n The straight tip (ST) connector is a fiber-optic cable connector that uses a bayonet plug and socket. It was the first de facto standard connector for most commercial wiring using fiber cables and it is very commonly found in fiber networks. \n 筆直（ST）連接器是使用卡口插頭和插座的光纖電纜連接器。 它是大多數使用光纖電纜進行商業佈線的第一個事實上的標準連接器，並且在光纖網絡中非常常見。 \n The Lucent connector (LC) is a miniaturized version of the fiber-optic SC connector. It looks somewhat like the SC, but is half the size, with a 1.25 mm ferrule instead of 2.5 mm, making it very useful when connecting multiple devices in a small area, such as on a 24-port switch’s front panel. \n 朗訊連接器（LC）是光纖SC連接器的微型版本。 它看上去有點像SC，但尺寸只有一半，只有1.25毫米而不是2.5毫米的套圈，因此在小區域（例如24端口交換機的前面板）連接多個設備時非常有用。 \n The mechanical transfer-registered jack (MT-RJ) connector is a fiber-optic cable connector that is very popular for small-form-factor devices due to its small size. This connector houses two fibers and mates with locating pins on the plug. These connectors are commonly found connecting a switch to a patch panel, because both devices have a limited area on their front panels. \n 機械傳輸註冊插孔（MT-RJ）連接器是一種光纖電纜連接器，由於其尺寸小，在小型設備中非常受歡迎。 該連接器容納兩根光纖，並與插頭上的定位銷配對。 通常發現這些連接器將開關連接到配線架，因為兩個設備的前面板都有有限的區域。 \n \n \n \n \n Twisted Pair Cable \n 雙絞線 \n While fiber-optic cable is great for its speed, distance, and security, it hasn’t yet become commonplace in most networks. Instead, we are still using the same type of cabling we have been using for the past two to three decades — twisted pair. Twisted pair cable is the most popular physical LAN media in the world today. Each cable contains four pairs of individually insulated strands of copper wire. Each pair is twisted together to minimize the amount of electromagnetic interference (EMI). The more twists there are in the cable, the less EMI there will be. Twisted pair cable is broken up into two types: unshielded twisted pair (UTP) and shielded twisted pair (STP). \n 儘管光纜在速度，距離和安全性方面都非常出色，但在大多數網絡中尚未普及。 取而代之的是，我們仍在使用過去兩到三十年來一直使用的相同類型的電纜-雙絞線。 雙絞線電纜是當今世界上最流行的物理LAN介質。 每條電纜包含四對獨立絕緣的銅線。 每對絞合在一起以最大程度地減少電磁干擾（EMI）。 電纜中的扭曲越多，EMI越小。 雙絞線分為兩種類型：非屏蔽雙絞線（UTP）和屏蔽雙絞線（STP）。 \n \n Shielded twisted pair cable is built very similarly to unshielded twisted pair, except that the pairs of wires are also surrounded by a metallic shielding (like foil). This outer foil shielding minimizes the EMI to which the cable is exposed. This increases the security and reliability of the cable. Unfortunately, however, this also increases the cost of the cable, so it is typically used only in high-production environments where the extra security is worth the extra cost. \n 屏蔽雙絞線電纜的構造與非屏蔽雙絞線非常相似，不同的是，成對的電線也被金屬屏蔽層（如金屬箔）圍繞。 外部箔屏蔽層可最大程度地減小電纜所遭受的EMI。 這增加了電纜的安全性和可靠性。 但是，不幸的是，這也增加了電纜的成本，因此通常僅在高生產環境中使用，在這種環境中，額外的安全性值得額外的成本。 \n \n \n The more common type of cabling is unshielded twisted pair cable. Instead of using extra shielding, this cable relies on the twisting of its copper pairs to minimize the effects of EMI. Each twisted pair is twisted to insulate itself from the other pairs, and because there is no additional shielding, it is available at a lower cost than STP. Therefore, UTP is the most common media of choice for small office, home office, residential, and many commercial networks. \n 電纜的最常見類型是非屏蔽雙絞線電纜。 該電纜不使用額外的屏蔽，而是依靠其銅線對的絞合來最大程度地減小EMI的影響。 每個雙絞線都經過絞合，以使其自身與其他雙絞線絕緣，並且由於沒有額外的屏蔽，因此可以以比STP更低的成本獲得。 因此，UTP是小型辦公室，家庭辦公室，住宅和許多商業網絡中最常見的選擇媒體。 \n \n \n \n \n Categorizing Twisted Pair Cable\xa0分類雙絞線電纜 \n \n \n Twisted pair cable is categorized based on a category (cat) number. For example, cat 3, or category 3, is the oldest type of cable that we use. It was introduced back in the 1980s and 1990s for use in the first star topologies. The maximum throughput or bandwidth of cat 3 cabling is only 10 Mbps (megabits per second). The cat 3, like all twisted pair cabling, cannot go farther than 100 meters without using a repeater, switch, or active hub to amplify the signal. This limited distance is attributable to the copper wiring in these cables. As the signal travels over the copper wire, the natural resistance to the wire decreases the signal’s strength, and it eventually becomes too weak for the distant end to receive. For this reason, there is a 100 meter limitation when building and designing a twisted pair network. \n 雙絞線電纜根據類別（類別）編號進行分類。 例如，類別3（或類別3）是我們使用的最古老的電纜類型。 它是在1980年代和1990年代引入的，用於第一批星形拓撲。 Cat 3電纜的最大吞吐量或帶寬僅為10 Mbps（兆位/秒）。 與所有雙絞線電纜一樣，如果不使用中繼器，交換機或有源集線器來放大信號，則Cat 3不能走超過100米。 這種有限的距離歸因於這些電纜中的銅線。 當信號在銅線上傳輸時，導線的固有電阻會降低信號的強度，最終變得太弱，無法接收到遠端。 因此，在構建和設計雙絞線網絡時存在100米的限制。 \n \n \n \n Cat 5 cables were an improvement on the older cat 3 cables and contain more twists, giving them more shielding from EMI and a maximum bandwidth of 100 Mbps. Cat 5e, or cat 5 enhanced, increased the speed of the maximum throughput to one Gbps, or 1000 Mbps, and became a gap filler until cat 6 cabling became commonplace. \n Cat 5電纜是對較舊的Cat 3電纜的改進，並包含更多的絞合線，從而使它們具有更大的EMI屏蔽能力，最大帶寬為100 Mbps。 Cat 5e或Cat 5增強後，將最大吞吐量的速度提高到1 Gbps或1000 Mbps，並成為了空白，直到Cat 6電纜變得普遍為止。 \n \n \n Cat 6a overcomes the 37-55 meter limitation of cat 6 when used in 10GBaseT. Cat 7, the newest standard, is shielded and provides connections up to 10 Gbps with a maximum distance of 100 meters. “Cat 7 and cat 7a cabling will be used for backbone connections between servers within a data center” and “provide an alternative to using fiber-optic cabling within the data center” (from http://www.cablestogo.com/learning/library/data-center/cat7-overview ). \n 當在10GBaseT中使用時，Cat 6a克服了Cat 6的37-55米的限制。 最新標準Cat 7被屏蔽，並提供高達10 Gbps的連接，最大距離為100米。 “ Cat 7和Cat 7a電纜將用於數據中心內服務器之間的主干連接”，並且“提供在數據中心內使用光纖電纜的替代方法” \n \n \n All cable categories up to cat 5e and cat 6a have a maximum distance of 100 meters. When used in 10GBaseT, the maximum distance for cat 6 is 55 meters. Cat 7 is shielded and exceeds the 100 meter limit. As the category of the cable increases, so do the number of twists per inch and the frequency range, allowing for more data and improved protection against EMI. Best practice for copper cabling is \xa0 not \xa0 to run cable lengths to the maximum because attenuation will reduce data capacity. \n 直至Cat 5e和Cat 6a為止的所有電纜類別的最大距離為100米。 在10GBaseT中使用時，類別6的最大距離為55米。 Cat 7被屏蔽並超過100米的限制。 隨著電纜類別的增加，每英寸的捻數和頻率範圍也會增加，從而可以提供更多的數據並改善對EMI的保護。 銅纜佈線的最佳實踐是不要使電纜長度最大，因為衰減會降低數據容量。 \n \n \n \n Category \n Maximum Throughput \n LAN Application \n \n \n Cat 3 \n 10Mbps \n 10BaseT; 100BaseT4deprecated \n \n \n Cat 5 \n 100Mbps \n 10/100/1000BaseT100/1000BaseTX \n \n \n Cat 5e \n 1Gbps (1000Mbps) \n 10/100/1000BaseT100/1000BaseTX \n \n \n Cat 6 \n 1Gbps (1000Mbps) \n 10/100/1000BaseT100/1000BaseTX10GBaseT \n \n \n Cat 6a \n 10Gbps \n 10/100/1000BaseT100/1000/BaseTX10GBaseT \n \n \n Cat 7 \n 10Gbps \n 10/100/1000BaseT100/1000/BaseTX10GBaseT \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Twisted Pair Connectors\xa0雙絞線連接器 \n \n \n \n \n Twisted pair cables come with three main types of connectors. The first is the RJ-45 connector, which is an eight-pin connector used in Ethernet networks. Even though most Ethernet networks use only four pins, the RJ-45 provides eight pins for future use and capabilities. The first four pins are used to transmit (two pins) and receive (two pins). \n 雙絞線電纜帶有三種主要類型的連接器。 第一個是RJ-45連接器，它是以太網網絡中使用的八針連接器。 即使大多數以太網僅使用四個引腳，RJ-45仍提供八個引腳供將來使用和使用。 前四個引腳用於發送（兩個引腳）和接收（兩個引腳）。 \n \n \n \n The RJ-11 connector is used in the standard telephone system. The RJ-11 is a six-pin connector, but commonly only two pins are used for a telephone (transmit and receive). If you have a two-line phone, then four pins are used: two pins to transmit and two pins to receive. \n RJ-11連接器用於標準電話系統。 RJ-11是一個六針連接器，但電話通常僅使用兩個針（發送和接收）。 如果您有兩線電話，則使用四個引腳：兩個引腳用於發送，兩個引腳用於接收。 \n \n \n \n Finally, the DB-9 connector is used for RS-232 signals. This connector looks like a standard serial connector. It is used commonly for asynchronous serial communications, like connecting to an external modem. In modern networks, you will see this type of connector on a “rollover cable.” A rollover cable has a DB-9 on one side (which is connected to your laptop’s serial port), and an RJ-45 connector on the other side (which is used to connect to Cisco routers and switches to do administration tasks). \n 最後，DB-9連接器用於RS-232信號。 該連接器看起來像標準的串行連接器。 它通常用於異步串行通信，例如連接到外部調製解調器。 在現代網絡中，您將在“翻轉電纜”上看到這種類型的連接器。 翻轉電纜的一側為DB-9（連接到筆記本電腦的串行端口），另一側為RJ-45連接器（用於連接到Cisco路由器和交換機以執行管理任務）。 \n \n \n \n A straight-through cable is a type of twisted pair cable that is used in local area networks to connect a computer to a network hub, such as a router. This type of cable is also sometimes called a patch cable. Both ends of the cable have an identical pinout, hence the name “straight-through.” A crossover cable switches the pinouts of the two ends of the cable, making the transmit and receive pins alternate on the two ends. This allows two workstations to connect directly to each other without the need for a hub, switch, or router. \n 直通電纜是雙絞線電纜的一種，在局域網中用於將計算機連接到網絡集線器（例如路由器）。 此類電纜有時也稱為跳線。 電纜的兩端都具有相同的引出線，因此名稱為“直通”。 交叉電纜切換電纜兩端的引腳分配，使發送和接收引腳在兩端交替。 這允許兩個工作站直接相互連接，而無需集線器，交換機或路由器。 \n \n \n \n Coaxial Cable \n 同軸電纜 \n \n \n Coaxial cable is a much older media technology. Coaxial cable, also known as coax for short, is composed of two conductors. The inner conductor, which is known as the insulated conductor (center wire), is the copper wire over which data is passed. The outer conductor is the braided metal shield and aids in protecting the inner wire from physical injury and the effects of EMI. Much like the shielding we saw in shielded twisted pair, the outer shield helps keep electromagnetic interference out of the data’s path. Between the inner conductor and the outer shield, we find an insulated core that prevents any data transfer between the inner core and outer shield. The outside of the cable is made of a flexible plastic jacket, much like the twisted pair cabling. Coaxial cabling was included in the first Ethernet standard as 10Base5 (thicknet) and continued to be used throughout updates as 10Base2 (thinnet) as well as being most commonly used in bus and ring networks. UTP cabling however, is easier to work with in a star topology and is significantly less expensive. \n 同軸電纜是一種較老的媒體技術。同軸電纜（也簡稱為同軸電纜）由兩個導體組成。內部導體（稱為絕緣導體（中心線））是在其上傳遞數據的銅線。外導體是編織的金屬屏蔽層，有助於保護內線免受物理傷害和EMI的影響。就像我們在屏蔽雙絞線中看到的屏蔽一樣，外部屏蔽有助於將電磁干擾排除在數據路徑之外。在內部導體和外部屏蔽層之間，我們找到了一個絕緣芯，可防止在內芯和外部屏蔽層之間進行任何數據傳輸。電纜的外部由柔軟的塑料護套製成，非常類似於雙絞線電纜。同軸電纜已包含在第一個以太網標準中，稱為10Base5（Thicknet），並在整個更新中繼續用作10Base2（Thinnet），並且在總線和環形網絡中最常用。但是，UTP電纜更容易在星形拓撲中使用，並且價格便宜得多。 \n \n \n \n Coaxial Cable Types\xa0同軸電纜類型 \n \n \n \n There are three dominant coaxial cable types. The RG-6 is commonly used by cable TV companies to connect individual homes to the TV network. These cables are thick and usually used for outside connections to withstand the effects of the weather. The RG-58 is a type of coaxial cable that was heavily used in early 10Base2 (thinnet) networks, such as bus and ring topologies. Finally, the RG-59 is the traditional coaxial cable used to carry composite video between two nearby devices, such as your TV and the cable box. If you are a cable Internet user, this is also used to carry the WAN connection from your wall jack to your cable modem. \n 共有三種主要的同軸電纜類型。 有線電視公司通常使用RG-6將單個房屋連接到電視網絡。 這些電纜很粗，通常用於外部連接以承受天氣的影響。 RG-58是一種同軸電纜，在諸如總線和環形拓撲之類的早期10Base2（瘦網）網絡中大量使用。 最後，RG-59是傳統的同軸電纜，用於在兩個附近的設備（例如電視和電纜盒）之間傳送複合視頻。 如果您是有線Internet用戶，這也可用於將WAN連接從牆壁插孔連接到電纜調製解調器。 \n \n \n \n Coaxial Cable Connectors\xa0同軸電纜連接器 \n \n \n \n \n While there were three types of cables, there are only two types of common connectors used with coaxial cable. The first is called BNC, from the name Bayonet Neill-Concelman. Sometimes people also call this the British Naval connector, because the BNC was heavily used by the British in their shipboard radio systems. This connector was commonly used in early Ethernet networks and it has a “push and twist” type of connector to secure the cable to the network device. \n 雖然有三種類型的電纜，但是只有兩種類型的普通連接器與同軸電纜一起使用。 第一個稱為BNC，名稱為刺刀Neill-Concelman。 有時人們也將其稱為英國海軍連接器，因為英國人在其艦載無線電系統中大量使用了BNC。 該連接器通常用於早期的以太網網絡，並且具有“推壓式”連接器，用於將電纜固定至網絡設備。 \n The F-type connector is the modern type of coaxial cable connector. It is typically used for cable TV and cable modem connections. It is connected by screwing the connector onto a threaded jack to secure the connection. \n F型連接器是現代類型的同軸電纜連接器。 它通常用於有線電視和電纜調製解調器的連接。 通過將連接器擰到帶螺紋的插孔上進行連接以固定連接。 \n \n \n \n Copper vs. Fiber \n 銅與光纖 \n When we compare the advantages and disadvantages of fiber-optic cables and copper (twisted pair) cables, we have to consider that fiber-optic has a higher bandwidth (measured in Gbps or Tbps), it can carry its signal many miles without the need of a repeater, it is immune to the effects of EMI, and it has much better security than traditional twisted pair cables. However, twisted pair cabling does hold some advantages of its own. For one, it is much less expensive than fiber-optic cabling. Also, copper wiring is much easier to install, taking only a few hours to learn. Finally, twisted pair cabling can be created and terminated using inexpensive tools. For example, a complete copper wiring toolset can be bought online for less than $50, while a complete fiber-optic kit may cost $1000 or more. For these reasons, copper has remained the dominant media in most local area networks. \n 當我們比較光纖電纜和銅纜（雙絞線）的優缺點時，我們必須考慮到光纖具有更高的帶寬（以Gbps或Tbps為單位），它可以將信號傳輸很多英里而無需 作為中繼器，它不受EMI的影響，並且比傳統的雙絞線電纜具有更好的安全性。 但是，雙絞線電纜確實具有其自身的一些優點。 首先，它比光纖電纜便宜得多。 而且，銅線的安裝更容易，只需幾個小時即可學習。 最後，可以使用廉價的工具來創建和終止雙絞線電纜。 例如，一套完整的銅線工具套件可以在線購買，價格不到50美元，而一套完整的光纖套件的價格可能在1000美元以上。 由於這些原因，銅一直是大多數局域網中的主要介質。 \n \n \xa0 \n \n \xa0 \n \n \xa0 \n \n \xa0 \n \n Converters \n 轉換器 \n \n Because of the wide variety of cable and connector types, there is sometimes a need to convert from one type of media to another. For example, if you have to make a connection between two LANs in buildings that are located one mile apart, but your network uses Cat 5e, UTP cabling, how can you make that connection? When you look at your routers, you find they only accept RJ-45 connections, but you know that you cannot run a Cat 5e cable more than 100 meters. How can you solve this problem? With a media converter. \n 由於電纜和連接器的類型多種多樣，有時需要從一種類型的媒體轉換為另一種類型的媒體。 例如，如果您必須在相距一英里的建築物中的兩個LAN之間建立連接，但是您的網絡使用Cat 5e，UTP電纜，那麼如何建立連接？ 當您查看路由器時，會發現它們僅接受RJ-45連接，但您知道不能將Cat 5e電纜的長度超過100米。 您如何解決這個問題？ 帶媒體轉換器。 \n Using a media converter, you can convert your RJ-45 connection into an ST, SC, or LC fiber connection, as shown in the image below. Then, you run the one-mile fiber cable to the other building, and use a media converter to convert from the ST, SC, or LC fiber connection back to the RJ-45 the other router requires. Because this is a simple, “dumb” device, it simply converts whatever is received on the first media type and repeats it back out the second media type. Common types of media converters are from Ethernet (copper) to fiber-optic (and back) or coaxial to fiber-optic (and back). \n 使用媒體轉換器，您可以將RJ-45連接轉換為ST，SC或LC光纖連接，如下圖所示。 然後，將一英里的光纜連接到另一座建築物，並使用媒體轉換器將ST，SC或LC光纖連接轉換回另一台路由器所需的RJ-45。 因為這是一個簡單的“啞”設備，所以它僅轉換在第一媒體類型上接收到的所有內容，然後將其重複播放回第二媒體類型。 媒體轉換器的常見類型是從以太網（銅）到光纖（然後向後）或同軸到光纖（然後向後）。 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n', 'tags': '', 'url': 'PCH\xa011.html'}]};
