Next, we will cover the various network relationships, such as client/server and peer-to-peer, and focus on the types of resources our networks use. Finally, we will talk about the topologies of our networks, such as the bus, the ring, the star, the full mesh, and hybrid network topologies. \n Network Defined By Geography \n \n \n \n \n Networks are defined by the geography they cover. We start with the area around a single person, with this area being termed the personal area network (PAN). Next, we expand outward to the local area network (LAN), which can contain an entire office floor or building. Moving outward again, we have the metropolitan area network, which covers the area across the city by connecting multiple LANs together. Finally, we have the wide area network (WAN). This is the largest network we define by geography and it can go across the country or even across the world. A great example of a WAN is the Internet, since it connects many networks together and stretches across the globe. \n \n Personal Area Network \n A PAN has a very small range limited to just a few meters. If you stretch your hands out at your sides and spin around in a circle, this is the physical range of most PANs. Bluetooth is one of the main things we use to create a PAN, although USB and infrared can also be used for these networks. Bluetooth has a range between one meter and 100 meters depending on which class of Bluetooth you are using, but most common Bluetooth devices are class two devices limited to 10 meters. Some good examples of PANs are the connection between a USB hard drive and a laptop, or a Bluetooth cellphone connecting to your car stereo system wirelessly. \n Local Area Network \n The next type of network defined by geography is the LAN, which stands for local area network. The local area network is comprised of several devices that allow computers to connect to each other within a small geographic area. A LAN is, at its most basic, a connection of several workstations together using a hub, switch, or wireless access point. LANs have a limited distance associated with them, with each network segment usually limited to 100 meters or less. Generally, a LAN is used to network the floor of an office, or possibly the entire office building in smaller networks. LANs are generally connected in either a wired or wireless manner. If wired, they are connected using unshielded twisted pair cable using the Ethernet (IEEE 802.3) standard; if wireless, they are connected using Wi-Fi radio signal (IEEE 802.11) standards. \n \n Metropolitan Area Networks \n Another way we can geographically define our networks is as a MAN. A metropolitan area network connects scattered locations across the city or county. This covers a larger geographical area than a local area network, but also a much smaller area than a wide-area network. \n \n Wide Area Networks \n The WAN is used to connect network components that are geographically separated over vast distances together. An example of a WAN would be to connect an office in Los Angeles to another corporate office in New York. This can be done using virtual private networks (VPNs) over the Internet or using dedicated leased lines that would physically connect the city pairs together. Regardless of the method of connection, once the two local area networks from Los Angeles and New York are connected, they become part of the larger wide area network topology. \n \n \n Network Defined by Relationships \n In addition to defining networks by geography or how much area they cover, you can also define them by the way they allocate their resources. The first method is what we call a client/server model. In a client/server model, a dedicated server or servers provide(s) access to files, scanners, printers, and other resources to client workstations. This simplifies the administration and backup burden, making the network centrally administered, and can provide better security because resources can be allocated according to job function, network privilege, or department, since all of the resources are located on a few key servers. The second way of sharing resources on the network is called the peer-to-peer model. In the peer-to-peer model, all workstations are considered equals: each computer or workstation shares its resources directly with the other workstations. There is no central administration. For example, if I shared my printer with my coworkers, then each time my coworker printed a document, it would be sent to the printer through my workstation. The drawback to this is that if my computer is turned off, my coworkers lose access to my resources, such as my printer. The administration and backup under the peer-to-peer model is much more difficult, since resources are located on numerous workstations across the network, making administrative tasks burdensome. Furthermore, there is no real way of securing network resources when allowing access between nodes or workstations. The benefit of peer-to-peer resource sharing is the low cost of entry, since no dedicated servers or specialized operating systems are required to share the resources. \n \n \n Network Defined by Topology \n Besides geography and relationships, we can also define our networks by their topology. When we define our networks by their topology, we consider both the physical and logical topology, and both of these topologies do not have to match for a single network. The physical topology determines how the devices are physically connected, while the logical topology determines how the traffic flows across the network in a logical manner. There are many types of topologies, including bus, ring, star, full mesh, and hybrid. Currently, the most widely used model is a physical star and a logical bus topology using Ethernet. \n Bus Topology \n \n \n Bus topology typically uses a single cable running through the area that needs network connectivity, with each device that wishes to connect to the network tapping into that cable. The devices tap into the cable using either a T connector (see diagram below) or a vampire tap. A vampire tap is actually a type of connection where a metal tooth bites into the cable, making a physical connection with the copper wire running inside the cable. While bus topology is an older technology and not commonly used anymore, physically, it can still be found as a logical implementation in some instances. \n \n Ring Topology \n Ring topology typically uses a cable running in a circular loop, with each device connected to the ring. Data travels in a single direction around the ring. The most common use of ring topology is with backbone fiber networks. Fiber distributed data interface (FDDI) is a set of standards for transmitting data on fiber-optic lines in a LAN. FDDI commonly uses two counter-rotating rings to provide more redundancy. Each device waits its turn to communicate on the ring by passing a token around the ring. Therefore, ring topology networks are also called token ring networks. As there are two counter-rotating rings, FDDI tends to provide a little more redundancy than a standard bus topology. However, both bus and ring topologies were quickly replaced in most LANs by the star topology. \n \n Star Topology \n Star topology is by far the most common topology in use today. We find star topologies in use in nearly all local area networks. All the devices of the star topology connect to a single point. That single point of connection can be a hub or switch. In most modern networks, the single connection point will be a switch. Star topologies are the dominant physical topology today, although they are not always used as the logical topology. Ethernet cabling, also known as unshielded twisted-pair, is very commonly employed in local area networks using a star configuration. However, fiber-optic connections can also be used for high-speed or high-security networks. The downside with the star topology is that it creates a single point of failure. If a central device such as a switch fails, the entire network fails as well. Star topologies have the benefit of reduced expense and make expansion very easy, unlike bus and ring network varieties. \n \n Full Mesh Topology \n To deal with the issue of redundancy, the full mesh topology was created. This topology is by far the most redundant, and expensive, topology because every node or workstation in the network is directly connected to every other node. While this provides optimal routing, it is very expensive to maintain and operate. The number of connections required for any number of nodes can be calculated by using the formula, x = n(n-1)/2. For example, if you have six nodes, that would require 15 cables to connect them all to each other. If you had 50 nodes, that would require 1225 separate connections. You can certainly see why this topology is almost never used for local area networks, as the number of machines would drive the number of connections up too quickly. \n \n Partial Mesh Topology \n To solve the cost issues created by the full mesh topology, engineers created the partial mesh topology. Partial mesh topology is really a hybrid full mesh topology. It provides redundancy and optimal routing between some sites, while avoiding the expense of connecting every single site. In order to create this successfully, though, you must consider the network traffic patterns to design it efficiently. \n \n \n \n \n \n', 'tags': '', 'url': 'PCH\xa09.html'}, {'title': 'PCH\xa010', 'text': 'PCH 10: Networking Hardware \n \n \n Network Devices \n Overview \n \n \n Network devices vary according to their purpose. In this module, we will discuss various devices, such as hubs, switches, routers, bridges, network adapters, and media. As we discuss the devices, you should pay attention to their uses, their benefits, and their limitations. We will also explore how to install a network adapter. \n Hub \n \n \n \n \n Hubs are among the most simplistic networking devices and are used to connect multiple network devices and workstations to each other, thereby forming a network. Hubs are also known as multiport repeaters. A hub works by accepting a signal in one port and rebroadcasting that same signal out to all of its other ports. Standard hubs do not have any “intelligence” (ability to change in response to varying situations or requirements), so we often refer to them as “dumb hubs.” Hubs can be classified as either active or passive. An active hub repeats the signal it receives on all of its ports and amplifies that signal to full strength. Passive hubs only repeat the signal without adding any amplification. Hubs are an older technology that can be used to easily increase the number of ports available, but this can lead to excessive network errors and collisions. There are newer variants of hubs called smart hubs. Smart hubs are essentially active hubs with enhanced feature sets, such as the use of simple network management protocol (SNMP). \n Three basic types of Ethernet hubs are as follows: \n \n Passive hub – repeats signal with no amplification \n Active hub – repeats signal with amplification \n Smart hub – active hub with enhanced features (ex: SNMP) \n \n Hubs have no inherent security designed within them because they simply rebroadcast all the information received from one port to every other port. Essentially, hubs rely on the connected workstations to only “listen” to the information on their port if that information is specifically addressed to that workstation. When the information is not addressed to it, the workstation is supposed to simply ignore the data. But a network card can be placed into “promiscuous” mode, where it will listen to all traffic, regardless of which workstation that traffic is addressed to. This makes hubs very insecure. \n Another drawback of hubs is that they have to share bandwidth, as all devices operate in one collision domain. Therefore, if you have a 100 Mbps hub, but connect four devices to that hub, your devices will effectively be operating at 25 Mbps each. This can lead to huge slowdowns in your network traffic when using a 16-, 24-, or 48-port hub. \n \n Bridges \n Because hubs operate with all devices acting in a single collision domain, a network device that could break up that collision domain into smaller units is required to help the network operate more efficiently. For example, if a hub is connected to another hub, they both operate under a single \xa0 collision domain \xa0 . A bridge is used to connect two hubs together, but still keep the hubs’ collision domains separate. This interconnection of multiple network segments together allows networks to scale into large networks without significantly decreasing the performance of that network. Bridges are smarter than hubs; in fact, they actually analyze the source \xa0 media access control (MAC) addresses \xa0 in the frames entering the bridge and populate an internal MAC table based on those addresses. Future routing decisions are based upon those destination MAC addresses. This intelligent forwarding based on the destination MAC address in the frame allows for a decrease in network traffic by only forwarding information to the root hub associated with the network device. Network switches, which we will discuss, are the evolution of hubs and bridges. \n \n \n Switches \n \n \n \n \n Switches are used to connect multiple network segments together, whether they connect from switch to switch, or switch to workstation. Each port on a switch acts as its own collision domain. A switch is an evolution from a hub and bridge. Essentially, each port on a switch operates as if it were a hub with a bridge connecting the ports of the hub to the workstation, thereby reducing the chance of a collision on the network to zero. \n Switches are intelligent devices that make forwarding decisions based upon the MAC addresses they learn and place in their MAC tables. A switch analyzes the source MAC addresses in frames as they enter the switch, and then populates the switch’s internal MAC table with the addresses to match them with the switch ports. This allows the switch to forward the frame only to the correct device on a single switch port, thereby increasing security and network speed. \n If a switch receives a frame but does not have the destination MAC address in its forwarding table, it will flood the frame to all ports except the source to solicit the location of the destination MAC address. Switches break up collision domains but create \xa0 broadcast domains \xa0 . \n Security is increased because only the device to which the information is addressed can receive a copy, regardless of whether the card is in “promiscuous” mode. This is similar in operation to an old-fashioned telephone operator switchboard. If the information isn’t addressed to your port, your port won’t receive the information. Also, because each port is in its own collision domain, the network speed is increased. Regardless of how many devices are on the network, each switch port has full-speed operations, so for a 100 Mbps switch, each device operates at 100 Mbps. \n \n Routers \n Routers move data packets (layer 3), as opposed to switches (layer 2), which move frames. Routers separate network segments based on IP addressing and will only forward packets out of the segment when configured to do so. This design breaks up broadcast domains created by switches. It is up to the network professional to configure the router to connect different networks together and perform intelligent routing decisions. A router is most closely associated with a computer in that it has a processor and a sophisticated OS. The router compares the IP address of the source and destination of the packet and forwards traffic to/from a network based on this logical address (IPv4 and IPv6 addresses, for example). Routers are typically feature-rich devices and support a wide range of interface types, including unshielded twisted pair, fiber optic, and coaxial cable connections. Like a switch, each port on a router is a separate collision domain. Using access control lists, routers have the ability to block access to networks based on ports or addresses. This blocking adds to the network’s security. \n \n \n Network Adapter \n The network adapter is used to connect a workstation to the network through the use of media. The network adapter can be built in to the motherboard of the device in several ways: \n \n Using an integrated port cluster. \n Added to a workstation through the use of an internal expansion card (PCIe, PCI, or mini-PCIe). \n Through the use of an externally connected card, such as USB or PCMCIA. \n \n There are two main types of network adapters: wired and wireless. The wired cards support various cable types, such as unshielded twisted pair (UTP), fiber optic, and coaxial cabling. These various cable types are called media. \n Media \n Media is the term used to categorize the physical connection between two device ports, such as between a computer and a switch. Media is made up of copper cable, fiber-optic cable, or even radio frequency waves (as used in Wi-Fi networks). Media varies greatly in cost, from free for radio waves, to cheap for unshielded twisted pair (copper cable), to expensive for fiber-optic cabling. The type of media determines the bandwidth speed, capacity, and distance limitations for a particular network. We will discuss media in more depth in a future module. \n \n \n Install a Network Adapter \n There are times when you may need to install an add-on network interface card (NIC). Current desktop motherboards should have a built-in NIC on the rear input/output (I/O) panel. Installing an add-on card can keep a machine in service if the built-in NIC is defective or if you need to upgrade to match the current local area network (LAN) specifications (i.e., from a 10/100 BaseT to 10/100/1000 or 10GBaseT). \n To install an NIC, follow these steps: \n \n Check documentation to verify which NIC will match your expansion slots (PCI or PCIe) and the LAN requirements. Ensure that the adapter will work with the motherboard. \n Power down the computer and disconnect the main power cord from the machine. \n Following safe repair practice (proper grounding/anti-static strap), open the side cover of the computer to inspect available expansion slots. \n Match the connector/pinouts of the new NIC card and verify it matches the proposed slot. \n Remove the corresponding computer PCI option slot cover from the back panel. \n Line up the connector of the NIC to the expansion slot and seat it firmly as you guide the bracket up to the back panel of the computer, ensuring proper alignment. Tighten the new NIC with the screw that is usually supplied. \n Close the side cover of the computer following safe repair procedures. \n Reconnect the main power cord. \n Power up the machine. \n \n After the NIC hardware is installed, the drivers should install automatically, depending on the operating system. For Windows (Vista/Win7/Win8.1/Win10), verify connectivity in the network and sharing center. For Linux, go to network settings, and search online for the appropriate driver depending on the \xa0 Linux distribution \xa0 , such as Red Hat Linux or Ubuntu). \n \n \n \n \n \n \n', 'tags': '', 'url': 'PCH\xa010.html'}, {'title': 'PCH\xa011', 'text': 'PCH 11: Networking Media \n \n \n Fiber-Optic Cable \n \n Overview \n \n In this module, we’re going to discuss the various types of network media. We will begin with fiber-optic cable and then discuss twisted pair cable and coaxial cable. For each of these cable types, we will discuss appearance, characteristics, and types of connectors, as well as speed and limitations. \n \n \n Fiber-Optic Cable \n \n \n \n \n Fiber-optic cables are constructed by using a glass core at the center of the cable that is surrounded by cladding. In order to send data from one end of the cable to the other, light from a light-emitting diode (LED) or laser is used to transmit the signal down the glass fiber at the center of the cable. Because the data is being transmitted using light, it is immune to the effects of electromagnetic interference (EMI) that impact traditional copper-based cables, such as twisted pair and coaxial cables. Fiber-optic cables possess the ability to send the data a very far distance (many miles) without the use of a repeater. They also can carry a significant amount of data due to their large bandwidth and the information traveling at light speed. Their bandwidth can be measured in gigabits or even terabits per second. There are two types of fiber cables: multimode and single-mode fiber. \n \n \n \n Multimode fiber cables (MMF) contain a larger core than the single-mode variety. The core size for a multimode fiber is 62.5 microns. A micron is a very small unit of measurement—it is actually even smaller than the width of a human hair. MMF’s larger core enables multiple modes of travel for the light from one end of the cable to the other. This allows a single fiber to carry multiple signals across it, with each signal being transmitted at a slightly different reflective angle. When the light reaches the destination, the signals are then converted back into 1s and 0s and passed to the computer by the network interface card. Multimode fiber is commonly used in shorter distance fiber connections, such as from a router to a switch, a switch to a switch, or a server to a switch. \n Single-mode fiber cables (SMF) contain a much smaller core than the multimode variety. The core size for SMF is 10 microns. SMF’s smaller core only allows for a single mode of travel for the light from one end of the cable to the other. This straight-through connection allows for data to travel longer distances without a repeater than it can travel using MMF. When the light reaches the destination, the signals are then converted back into 1s and 0s and passed to the computer by the network interface card. Single mode fiber is commonly used in very long distance fiber connections, such as a backbone connection from one local area network to another. \n \n Fiber-Optic Cable Connectors \n \n \n \n \n Fiber cables only come in the two types discussed above: single-mode and multimode. However, the ends of each of these cables come in four varieties. \n The subscriber connector (SC) is a fiber-optic cable connector that uses a push-pull mechanism to latch into the port, similar to common audio and video cables. If you want to enable bidirectional transmission for sending and receiving data, you need to have two fiber cables, so sometimes a dual SC connector is used. \n The straight tip (ST) connector is a fiber-optic cable connector that uses a bayonet plug and socket. It was the first de facto standard connector for most commercial wiring using fiber cables and it is very commonly found in fiber networks. \n The Lucent connector (LC) is a miniaturized version of the fiber-optic SC connector. It looks somewhat like the SC, but is half the size, with a 1.25 mm ferrule instead of 2.5 mm, making it very useful when connecting multiple devices in a small area, such as on a 24-port switch’s front panel. \n The mechanical transfer-registered jack (MT-RJ) connector is a fiber-optic cable connector that is very popular for small-form-factor devices due to its small size. This connector houses two fibers and mates with locating pins on the plug. These connectors are commonly found connecting a switch to a patch panel, because both devices have a limited area on their front panels. \n \n Twisted Pair Cable \n While fiber-optic cable is great for its speed, distance, and security, it hasn’t yet become commonplace in most networks. Instead, we are still using the same type of cabling we have been using for the past two to three decades — twisted pair. Twisted pair cable is the most popular physical LAN media in the world today. Each cable contains four pairs of individually insulated strands of copper wire. Each pair is twisted together to minimize the amount of electromagnetic interference (EMI). The more twists there are in the cable, the less EMI there will be. Twisted pair cable is broken up into two types: unshielded twisted pair (UTP) and shielded twisted pair (STP). \n \n Shielded twisted pair cable is built very similarly to unshielded twisted pair, except that the pairs of wires are also surrounded by a metallic shielding (like foil). This outer foil shielding minimizes the EMI to which the cable is exposed. This increases the security and reliability of the cable. Unfortunately, however, this also increases the cost of the cable, so it is typically used only in high-production environments where the extra security is worth the extra cost. \n The more common type of cabling is unshielded twisted pair cable. Instead of using extra shielding, this cable relies on the twisting of its copper pairs to minimize the effects of EMI. Each twisted pair is twisted to insulate itself from the other pairs, and because there is no additional shielding, it is available at a lower cost than STP. Therefore, UTP is the most common media of choice for small office, home office, residential, and many commercial networks. \n \n Categorizing Twisted Pair Cable \n \n \n Twisted pair cable is categorized based on a category (cat) number. For example, cat 3, or category 3, is the oldest type of cable that we use. It was introduced back in the 1980s and 1990s for use in the first star topologies. The maximum throughput or bandwidth of cat 3 cabling is only 10 Mbps (megabits per second). The cat 3, like all twisted pair cabling, cannot go farther than 100 meters without using a repeater, switch, or active hub to amplify the signal. This limited distance is attributable to the copper wiring in these cables. As the signal travels over the copper wire, the natural resistance to the wire decreases the signal’s strength, and it eventually becomes too weak for the distant end to receive. For this reason, there is a 100 meter limitation when building and designing a twisted pair network. \n Cat 5 cables were an improvement on the older cat 3 cables and contain more twists, giving them more shielding from EMI and a maximum bandwidth of 100 Mbps. Cat 5e, or cat 5 enhanced, increased the speed of the maximum throughput to one Gbps, or 1000 Mbps, and became a gap filler until cat 6 cabling became commonplace. \n Cat 6a overcomes the 37-55 meter limitation of cat 6 when used in 10GBaseT. Cat 7, the newest standard, is shielded and provides connections up to 10 Gbps with a maximum distance of 100 meters. “Cat 7 and cat 7a cabling will be used for backbone connections between servers within a data center” and “provide an alternative to using fiber-optic cabling within the data center” (from http://www.cablestogo.com/learning/library/data-center/cat7-overview ). \n All cable categories up to cat 5e and cat 6a have a maximum distance of 100 meters. When used in 10GBaseT, the maximum distance for cat 6 is 55 meters. Cat 7 is shielded and exceeds the 100 meter limit. As the category of the cable increases, so do the number of twists per inch and the frequency range, allowing for more data and improved protection against EMI. Best practice for copper cabling is \xa0 not \xa0 to run cable lengths to the maximum because attenuation will reduce data capacity. \n \n \n \n Category \n Maximum Throughput \n LAN Application \n \n \n Cat 3 \n 10Mbps \n 10BaseT; 100BaseT4deprecated \n \n \n Cat 5 \n 100Mbps \n 10/100/1000BaseT100/1000BaseTX \n \n \n Cat 5e \n 1Gbps (1000Mbps) \n 10/100/1000BaseT100/1000BaseTX \n \n \n Cat 6 \n 1Gbps (1000Mbps) \n 10/100/1000BaseT100/1000BaseTX10GBaseT \n \n \n Cat 6a \n 10Gbps \n 10/100/1000BaseT100/1000/BaseTX10GBaseT \n \n \n Cat 7 \n 10Gbps \n 10/100/1000BaseT100/1000/BaseTX10GBaseT \n \n \n \n \n Twisted Pair Connectors \n \n \n \n \n Twisted pair cables come with three main types of connectors. The first is the RJ-45 connector, which is an eight-pin connector used in Ethernet networks. Even though most Ethernet networks use only four pins, the RJ-45 provides eight pins for future use and capabilities. The first four pins are used to transmit (two pins) and receive (two pins). \n The RJ-11 connector is used in the standard telephone system. The RJ-11 is a six-pin connector, but commonly only two pins are used for a telephone (transmit and receive). If you have a two-line phone, then four pins are used: two pins to transmit and two pins to receive. \n Finally, the DB-9 connector is used for RS-232 signals. This connector looks like a standard serial connector. It is used commonly for asynchronous serial communications, like connecting to an external modem. In modern networks, you will see this type of connector on a “rollover cable.” A rollover cable has a DB-9 on one side (which is connected to your laptop’s serial port), and an RJ-45 connector on the other side (which is used to connect to Cisco routers and switches to do administration tasks). \n A straight-through cable is a type of twisted pair cable that is used in local area networks to connect a computer to a network hub, such as a router. This type of cable is also sometimes called a patch cable. Both ends of the cable have an identical pinout, hence the name “straight-through.” A crossover cable switches the pinouts of the two ends of the cable, making the transmit and receive pins alternate on the two ends. This allows two workstations to connect directly to each other without the need for a hub, switch, or router. \n \n \n \n Coaxial Cable \n \n \n Coaxial cable is a much older media technology. Coaxial cable, also known as coax for short, is composed of two conductors. The inner conductor, which is known as the insulated conductor (center wire), is the copper wire over which data is passed. The outer conductor is the braided metal shield and aids in protecting the inner wire from physical injury and the effects of EMI. Much like the shielding we saw in shielded twisted pair, the outer shield helps keep electromagnetic interference out of the data’s path. Between the inner conductor and the outer shield, we find an insulated core that prevents any data transfer between the inner core and outer shield. The outside of the cable is made of a flexible plastic jacket, much like the twisted pair cabling. Coaxial cabling was included in the first Ethernet standard as 10Base5 (thicknet) and continued to be used throughout updates as 10Base2 (thinnet) as well as being most commonly used in bus and ring networks. UTP cabling however, is easier to work with in a star topology and is significantly less expensive. \n \n Coaxial Cable Types \n \n \n \n There are three dominant coaxial cable types. The RG-6 is commonly used by cable TV companies to connect individual homes to the TV network. These cables are thick and usually used for outside connections to withstand the effects of the weather. The RG-58 is a type of coaxial cable that was heavily used in early 10Base2 (thinnet) networks, such as bus and ring topologies. Finally, the RG-59 is the traditional coaxial cable used to carry composite video between two nearby devices, such as your TV and the cable box. If you are a cable Internet user, this is also used to carry the WAN connection from your wall jack to your cable modem. \n Coaxial Cable Connectors \n \n \n \n \n While there were three types of cables, there are only two types of common connectors used with coaxial cable. The first is called BNC, from the name Bayonet Neill-Concelman. Sometimes people also call this the British Naval connector, because the BNC was heavily used by the British in their shipboard radio systems. This connector was commonly used in early Ethernet networks and it has a “push and twist” type of connector to secure the cable to the network device. \n The F-type connector is the modern type of coaxial cable connector. It is typically used for cable TV and cable modem connections. It is connected by screwing the connector onto a threaded jack to secure the connection. \n \n \n Copper vs. Fiber \n When we compare the advantages and disadvantages of fiber-optic cables and copper (twisted pair) cables, we have to consider that fiber-optic has a higher bandwidth (measured in Gbps or Tbps), it can carry its signal many miles without the need of a repeater, it is immune to the effects of EMI, and it has much better security than traditional twisted pair cables. However, twisted pair cabling does hold some advantages of its own. For one, it is much less expensive than fiber-optic cabling. Also, copper wiring is much easier to install, taking only a few hours to learn. Finally, twisted pair cabling can be created and terminated using inexpensive tools. For example, a complete copper wiring toolset can be bought online for less than $50, while a complete fiber-optic kit may cost $1000 or more. For these reasons, copper has remained the dominant media in most local area networks. \n \n \n Converters \n \n Because of the wide variety of cable and connector types, there is sometimes a need to convert from one type of media to another. For example, if you have to make a connection between two LANs in buildings that are located one mile apart, but your network uses Cat 5e, UTP cabling, how can you make that connection? When you look at your routers, you find they only accept RJ-45 connections, but you know that you cannot run a Cat 5e cable more than 100 meters. How can you solve this problem? With a media converter. \n Using a media converter, you can convert your RJ-45 connection into an ST, SC, or LC fiber connection, as shown in the image below. Then, you run the one-mile fiber cable to the other building, and use a media converter to convert from the ST, SC, or LC fiber connection back to the RJ-45 the other router requires. Because this is a simple, “dumb” device, it simply converts whatever is received on the first media type and repeats it back out the second media type. Common types of media converters are from Ethernet (copper) to fiber-optic (and back) or coaxial to fiber-optic (and back). \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n', 'tags': '', 'url': 'PCH\xa011.html'}]};
